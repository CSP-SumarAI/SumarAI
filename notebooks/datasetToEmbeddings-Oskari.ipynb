Hi, I'm Anna and I'm American. My name is Hannah and I'm British. So sit back and relax you're among friends. And let's talk murder. Now. Today's episode is really special because it is the conclusion of spooky month. Which in my opinion is probably the best month. You're right. I love Halloween is the best time of year. For the whole month, really? Yes spooky season. It's pretty great. I mean in general you could start wearing sweaters boots, you know, go completely black and goth and coffee. Yeah spice lattes if that's your sort of basic thing, you know, which is because it is and if you're a more murdery, no than its quad gourd season. Yeah, exactly. The only thing that I've noticed so I've been living in England for just a couple of years. And England doesn't do Halloween like North America does which is kind of a bummer, but I guess I just sort of get used to it. Where is like in Canada? It feels like everything is draped in fake cobwebs from like October 5th and on like the stores go all out all the houses go all out costumes go all out. We're here in England. Not that so much of a popular thing. Now, it's I noticed that too because I'm America as well. It's insane. Like people go nuts for Halloween. It's a big thing. I mean nobody costume people decorate their whole house. I mean some go even more nuts than Christmas with the whole house decorating. I mean, it's a massive massive thing and every house participates like here you might get obviously I have a little one so I have been trick-or-treating here with her and you might get like two houses on the street. It's just it's pretty pathetic but  But it's only because you guys don't do it. Yeah, I was never really like a thing when I was a kid. I mean it really bad Halloween, but we never went trick-or-treating we didn't do like costumes that much there were like the occasional Halloween party. But like that was a yeah, but I think that's mainly because we don't a bigger event in the UK is probably Guy Fawkes Night. Yeah, and it's so full of November. Yes, I bonfire night which is I think more of our like traditionally  British thing today. Yes, you do firework doesn't everything you don't think we set things on fire. So we do that more in Fourth of July. Yeah. I just remember like growing up in Canada Halloween you get your costume ready? Like two months in advance. So shout out to know you're like you're literally talking about it. Aren't you like for with your friends? Oh, yeah who can come up with the best costume? Yes, and then you all go to Value Village. Shout out to Value Village anybody who lived loves Value Village they are  Like a charity shop, but they go full out on Halloween because everybody goes there to buy their costume. So like you by bits and pieces and whatever so you go to Value Village. I remember one year. I must have been I want to say like nine and I was a mad scientist for Halloween true story. I'll have to dig up a picture and my mom was so good at costumes. We got this white lab coat and then ping pong balls. We like glued all over and Drew like little eyeballs on them.  And then I got like a one of the you know, like the dollar store has like a packet of plastic bugs so glued plastic bags all over I had a giant like plastic rat that we like so to my shoulder and then my mom in her absolute Grace and wisdom because it is a Halloween in Canada and it's fucking cold. She built this hat. Basically that was pink sort of like Shivani material that she  She sewed and wrapped up and put it onto a hat. So it looked like an exposed. Brain. Oh my God. Yeah, I'm not kidding and buy things like oh, so it's like a it looks really fucking cool. You're a mad scientist with an exposed brain and be your warm as hell because it's an actual hat and it's Halloween in Canada. So it might be snowing. I just like that is Halloween next to buying and a Ouija board from Zellers and then like doing the basement and like getting everybody.  Is that to me is like the perfect Halloween?  That's so funny that you mentioned about because you do have to factor in that you have to be warm because it's cold. So where I grew up in the DC area and it was cold. So you have to fact that you have your costume, but you have to work in how to get a jacket or like yeah thermals underneath it. So yeah take that into account. A lot of times you'd like by if you were buying costume at least you have to buy like a size too big so you can get your coat on underneath but then complain because it's like well, I want to be like a sexy  Cheerleader but I Gotta Wear My snowsuit on underneath this costume exactly exactly, but it was always I think more now they may call you get like the cheap Chinese with not Chinese, but I guess they made in China. They're made somewhere in a factory where they Mass produce like, you know, just the cheap costumes that you can buy where I love the the generic names on those. Oh, yeah, you're it's like wizard boy and this one. Yeah, exactly clearly a Harry Potter costume or something and do not stand close to an open flame because that now  they're definitely not claiming tried. I think they had to like legally start making them like whether like, you know, you're not just gonna immediately burst into flames like a child like you go near a feat only composed. Yeah, baby. I know back when I was younger to we made a lot of costumes that's like a big deal was to make them more so and that brings me to one of the things one of my costumes and I was desperately trying to find a picture right before we started and I'm gonna find it post it on the socials but one year.  Cited and this is the most non-scary geekiest thing ever, but I don't know why I've insisted I wanted to go as an artist. So I just wore this outfit where I made myself one of those  What are they called? Like I had a beret I have like this whole outfit with oh, do you have got a little bored? I'm bored. What are those things the palette palette and a paintbrush a carrier out and that and I just walk because I was like, I don't know but it was just and in that picture I have on white sweatpants and sweat shirt underneath the stuff because you know how you're trying again. You're trying to make yourself as warm as possible. So you have to like layer up. What kind of age are we talking here? Oh, I was like ten I mean and then nobody knew what I was.  Okay, let me know. What kid goes as an artist for Halloween. Like what a loser. I think between that and wanting to be an M&M one year, but that was like yeah, do you mean the kind of Eminem? I was a green one to be exact. Okay, but it was like I think you can probably buy the generic costumes now, but like what we live full on made it with like felt felt was your best friend Allie?  Queen oh, yeah, I remember one year. I it was a Value Village costume. We when I was a cheerleader like the most unsexy looking cheerleader, but I wanted to be a dead cheerleader because I thought I would be okay cool. So I bought a bunch of fake blood and you can get those it's almost I don't know what the material is but you put it on your face and spread it out and it looks like skin. It's disgusting and I need to cover my face in. Yeah, just not nice.  That was like a homemade Value Village. Let's not do a cheerleader. Let's do a dead cheerleader and it was disgusting like 13, right? That's cool. Yeah, but I just knowing you you're so not a chick like you're just like the opposite of like cheerleader, but then you say dead cheerleader and okay, that's definitely more you but then I think obviously Hannah you didn't do the trick or treating stuff. But I feel like you make it up. You've been making it up and your later adult life, but just by being a golf. Yeah exactly.  Really? You're like Halloween every day. You're not wrong. So, thanks.  So for this episode we were talking about what we wanted to do for spooky month and I think it was like this time last year maybe when we went camping maybe like late September. So the three of us went camping in Rye here in England and it was I don't know it was dark out. We all set out by our little homemade fire and we told murder mystery stories. So each of us told the story. It was super creepy. I'm sure everybody who was  Also camping was equally terrified because I'm pretty sure like our voices carry through that whole Campground, but I kind of wanted to do something similar where we gather around our virtual fire outside its spooky month and we're each going to tell a spooky murder mystery.  Normally here at murder friends. We tend to have fairly light episodes. Nothing to To Grim. I'd like to think a little bit a little bit lighter, but this is a different episode. So if you're not interested in really creepy fairly gruesome crimes, please go ahead and listen to one of our other episodes. This is just a special one-time thing. All of our episodes will not be this Grim. I promise.  I did some research on creepy stories. There's a couple that come to mind but none of them were really fitting and I found this one that I sort of did a little bit of a deep dive on and I yeah, you'll see why I chose it. So to set the scene imagine you're living at your family farm. It's beautiful Farm out in the in the woods your beloved maid quits because she keeps  Hearing strange noises in the house. That sucks not the end of the world but a bit creepy then you start finding newspapers in the house that no one in the family bought their actually from a city that's quite far away which nobody's travel to the house keys. Keep going missing. You see fresh footprints in the snow coming from the Dark Forest towards your farm leading to a broken door in the Farms machine room, but there are no tracks away from the  House, so the house on fire pretty much this guy. So this is the beginning of the infamous and I'm so sorry to all to German listeners hit hit enter. Now, I'm going to post it. I can't say I'm so sorry, but it is the story of the murders that happen at this Farmstead in 1922. So we got we're going back in time to a spooky.  Mystery out in Germany. So this is just a tiny small farm set about 70 kilometres north of Munich. It's one of the most gruesome and puzzling unsolved crimes in German history and it gave me nightmares. So on the evening of March thirty first nineteen twenty to six inhabitants of the farm were killed with a mattock which is like a pickaxe basically so the six victims  were the parents and dries and Seville again, so sorry for the names their Widow Widow daughter Victoria who was in her 30s and then Victoria's children who were seven and two and their new maid Maria. So like I mentioned some weird stuff started to happen before the attack so finding newspapers finding tracks to the house, but not out of the house the original  You'd quit. They was creepy noises in the night the family heard Footsteps in the Attic, but the father found nobody when he was searching the building. So overall 100% nightmare fuel creepy time. You do wonder which I'm sure I'll get to how do you kill six different people there? It's noisy or they going to be somebody's gonna wake up and then rot. I mean, it's just it seems insane. It's so it's so creepy. Anyway, okay, so  the father actually told several people about these observations, but he basically refused to accept help the details went unreported to the police. He was basically like I'm going to deal with it. It's not a big deal. No worries the family also reported seeing a man with a mustache. That's the only description we have a man with a mustache standing at the forage forests Edge and just staring at the house basically like watching them. Oh fuck creepy.  Also, I mean, it's a free country. I guess you can look wherever you want to look. So on the afternoon of the 31st the new maid Maria arrived. So Maria's sister a squirter her there and then left the farm shortly afterwards the sisters likely the last person to see everyone alive. So she literally drops off her sister at her new job. And then that's it. Basically the police believe that in the evening the sort of eldest daughter.  Victoria her seven-year-old daughter and the parents were lured to the barn where they were murdered one at a time. But I mean we're talking about the 1920s evidence collecting is not quite the same anymore. So really in this stage of the crime people don't know what happened. They believe that the perpetrator or perpetrators. They do not know how many people they use the pickaxe of belonging to the family.  Arm and killed the family with their own weapon. Basically, then the perpetrators moved into the house where they killed the maid in her bed with the same weapon and then presumably killed the two-year-old real sorry while he slept in his crib. So the family was lured to the barn the family was killed. The person went in the house got the maid and the remaining child. That's the basic premise. But even at this point people don't know.  So as you can imagine with the farm sort of out in the boonies, it took four days for people to discover that the family had actually died. They even had a machinist come out to the farm to work like to repair one of machines and he basically went worked and then left but he said he didn't he didn't even know. No, he said he didn't see any of the family and he heard nothing but sounds of the farm animals and the dog inside the bar.  So he's sort of waited around for a bit didn't see anybody thought. Well, I'm just going to do what I need to do left five hours later when he finished when he was in town. He talked about how it was super Erie and like the ghostly emptiness of the farm and how he didn't see anybody and basically that afternoon a party went back to the farm was like something's wrong. There's a lot of people at this farm and to not see anybody is not right. And so when they go back at this point four days later,  the bodies were found. It seems like it's so methodical because they would have had to know how many people were there to be able to like lure them out and like know what you're dealing because if you're it's not like you have this an automatic weapon where you're like you could you cannot to get to Graham about it. But like, you know, that's a lot of people try to contain. Yeah absolutely makes sense. And so it's almost even so Eerie. Oh, so they were worried about say they were all in the same place to threaten them into staying at the  Of those. Yeah word that makes sense to like lure them out. Look at like one after the other somehow or there I would have had to at least be like multiple people doing it. Yeah it I mean the crime itself is is super duper creepy and which is why I picked it. But also what's so frustrating is that the investigation was not really handled properly. Obviously, it's 1922. There's lots of things that they just didn't have or maybe hadn't even seen a crime like this before but basically  Basically, the crime was investigated by the Munich police and they originally were hampered by the number of people that interacted with the crime scene that bodies were moved that items removed even people cooked and ate in the Farms kitchen like while they were they're investigating. They're like, well, we're we're here who needs lunch kind of thing. Like they yeah the day after the discovery of the bodies the court physician performed the autopsies.  It was established that the madacorp like it's that basically an ice pick was most likely the murder weapon. The weapon itself was not at the scene. Then it goes on. I mean if some pretty Grim details, they're all pretty awful. I guess one of the things that makes this case a bit notorious. Oh is that the you can do it? I really do. All right. Here we go. Why do I always pick the most gruesome things to talk about? I'm so sorry, okay.  Okay, so the heads of the victims were removed and sent to Munich so they could be examined because the trauma all happen to the heads they thought well, why don't we just take all the heads and we'll go look at them in our lab. I'm not I am saying I know who's the head for evidence purposes and that's just Bonkers. Yeah all of them too. So they were kept in the Justice building and  We're later lost possibly destroyed in the Allied bombings of World War Two a couple days later after like all this happening. So we're just we're still in April the victims were buried in a cemetery. Obviously Sands heads. So imagine being like the UPS guy like who has to pick them up and take them and like you don't know or like, you know, yeah, I mean you go to the Post Office and that they asked you like what's inside is that yeah, it's me.  Like it's always just a book or always just a present for someone and you'll be like, oh this six human heads. Yeah, she's a success. And the first these has said they definitely had a bad review whoever like a prince put them someone's getting fired. I mean, uh, the police believe that the motive would be robbery but a large amount of money was actually found inside the house. So somebody did this for a very specific reason they realized that the  Trader or most likely perpetrators because obviously so many people died. I think it would be difficult if it was just one person, but they believe that the perpetrators stayed at the farm for several days after the killings because someone fed the cows had eaten an entire supply of bread from the kitchen took meat from the pantry. It's also possible. They were still there after the discovery of the bodies as neighbors reported smoke coming from the  the chimney after the fact did they not just check the house to be sure when they you know found the bodies. I mean, well, we'll get to that it's it gets creepier with no motive the police questioned more than a hundred suspects before closing the case in the 50s unsolved because it's such a notorious case and it's so gruesome and creepy there's still interest in it. But obviously at this point pretty much anybody associated with the Case is dead. There's no one left to talk.  So there there's a couple inconsistencies that mess up the investigation the original reporting belief that each family member went to the barn to the due to the restlessness sound of the animals. So it's almost like the animals were upset about something and then one by one they would go out to check on the animals, but then they found out that not even screams from the barn could be heard in the house. So why did for family members?  Boys go to the barn in the first place. They also the exact sequence of events. They couldn't be clarified without a doubt. They don't know really who died in what order or anything like that. There's only five pictures taken from the crime scene to with the bodies in the barn one of the maid in her bedroom. One of these small child's rekt crib and an outside view from the yard, no fingerprints were.  Secured the Assumption has always been that the killer was already on the premise and inside the roof before the ACT. Is it the roof? No, no. No because there were reports that they could hear footsteps and stuff. They believe that the Footsteps in the snow was them coming into the house and then the Footsteps in the Attic was them kind of moving around some of the evidence for this Theory includes that they were roof tiles that were shifted and there were like,  Hallowed bits out in hey, but then apparently and I don't know how substantiated is there might have been some activities by the father and daughter up in the roof that might be unrelated to the crime. So if that's the case, it makes sense why the father was like, oh nobody's up there because I move that stuff around or whatever on the night of the crime. So three days before the three or four days before the bodies wer\",\n",

Hello and welcome to dogs with sweaters podcast about whatever for whoever I Am Blake to my left. I have it should boy Logan and in front of me. I got I'm Jim and to my right your buddy Alec. So for our very first episode we are going to be discussing one movie a piece that we think encapsulates the Halloween season. What gets you in the mood for Halloween?  Makes you feel like fall it gets you all nice and warm makes you want to cuddle under a blanket and get a little spooked or maybe not sound good to everybody. Sounds good started cool.  Logan I'm going to have you kick us off. What is your pick? Well, I'm glad you asked Blake as if he wasn't going but yeah, but really the movie I picked I'll be honest and saying it doesn't necessarily scream a lot of Halloween undertones, but it is a movie that I end up watching on an annual basis usually around this time of year.  And that's got to be John Carpenter's The Thing Really. I think I just love that it decided to go in A Brave New Direction where a lot of movies, you know, you just kind of got the same cliched monster at the end of the day, but I think that was one of the first movies in my mind that really explored like body horror a whole lot and just like really vicious.  Visceral like Transformations and just the fact that it's an alien that can literally change into any living organism and assimilate with their DNA is just really nerve-wracking because you never know who's the bad guy in any given scene. So you're always kind of on edge.  And I just think it's one of those movies that has a lot of re-watch ability for me.  I feel like that's a movie that you know that you can watch it multiple, you know, maybe a dozen times and I've only seen it once or maybe twice and each time you watch it. You can maybe catch something new that you didn't catch the like the last time you watched it and you know, you build a little bit on, you know, the lure of the alien each time and I know that's a movie that there's a ton of you know, you know fannish.  Yeah fan pages out there, you know speculation on you know, what? What is the alien? Well, so, you know true sign aside from you know, the teeth and all that stuff. Yeah, and I definitely agree with you. I think that's a strong suit of that movie. I love where you know a movie will actually end and it's open to interpretation and I just think it's really interesting that it can spark a lot of conversations about  a movie even years after it's been released that movie came out and I think 82. Yeah, but yeah.  I'm going to I'm going to agree big big-time agree that movies and all time. Classic. Like quite might be my favorite horror movie of all time. Like maybe I debated with myself. Yeah, it's that that's that's a really good pick. My dad showed me that movie when I was probably way too young to watch it there. That's good old good old good old Sam. Yeah good old Sam, like just you know giving me the nightmares for  Weeks and weeks, but I really I really love that movie. I think all the acting and that movie is great Kurt Russell's hat is a character in that movie and it's great and disappeared talk about the two biggest are ya Russell's hat and Kurt Russell's beard. Now, you got Wilford Brimley diabeetus man, the whole the whole time that movie the bad guy in the thing is just diabetes. It's just like a it's like a just a vague like  Interpretation of what diabetes does longer right it changes you and what's their when it takes over the dog jumps up onto the ceiling. That's that's the literal interpretation of diabetes. But you know, there are subtle hints throughout the movie exactly to symbolism. It's just you know body transformation insulin resistance. Okay, for real Jamie where you get the most impressive thing about the movie I think is like the Practical effects absolutely probably hole.  Up so fucking well. Oh, yeah, and I think it's interesting that you bring that up because I could I could sit here for about two hours and discuss with somebody.  I like that. They tried to incorporate the prequel end of the story. I was just getting ready to bring that up. But God was a CGI. Yes, Mom. You know what? I like I know what you're getting ready to say. I'm a little bit. I'm I'm kind of about half on your side, I think.  Alec just say say what you're going to say. I'll come in. You know, it's not even right. I'm sure you guys are going to say but I'd never seen the thing until like maybe even six months ago the original the thing like six months ago and I saw the the prequel on TV 2011 one. Yeah, the I think it was actually made in like Scandinavia or like by Skinner are going Northern.  Minions, I saw that several years ago. I thought wow and I thought that was the thing. I thought that was the original one. I was like, well the oh, honey, and you know, I thought it was really good. I'm sure if I had seen John Carpenter's the first one and then seeing the second one. I would have thought the second one was shitty, but you know having seen the second one, you know, I thought it was good. It got pretty cheesy when they got like onto the  The don't think you have to they actually find the UFO and that part gets a little bit cheesy, but the rest is really good. Like when they actually remove it from the ice, I'll is good all like openly defend the plot of the prequel lot is really good lot is great. The acting is like a birdie. All right. Okay, dude, the the CGI in that movie just makes me want to kind of plant jump off of the Blues and they use like practical effects. That would have been there's a thank you can't budget you can find.  Will you can find there's a YouTuber named good bad flicks that did like a deep dive into the production of the the prequel to The Thing the one we're talking about and I guess they shot the whole like the entire movie with practical effects and they looked really good and you can find like raw footage of those practical effects. But you know, it's the the story of the fucking Century like, you know, the studio comes in and says, no these don't look, you know, yada yada or you know, you have to  stop using practical effects. You just use CGI because it's going to be cheaper to edit that rather than I don't know how movies are made a whole lot. But the studio told them they needed to use CGI rather than practical effects. And so I don't know to me like the prequel is watchable. I think it's good. Like I said if it was on like right now, I'd probably watch it but like I would vastly prefer the OG. Yeah. I watched them in the same order is Alec but I mean  All the prequel first. I did see the prequel first. And here's the thing that really separated. The experience for me is you know, I'd always been kind of like a weird person. I'm like, yeah, let's look up like very oddly specific scenes from horror movies on YouTube just to get an idea of what we've already like seen in the history of horror movies and there's some pretty big ones in the thing.  That I was aware of like particularly like the scene with the defibrillation and shit where the one guy is like a heart attack and they're trying to in the prequel and the original the original. Well the 80s. Yeah, but I'm not going to repay. Its I've only seen like we're not ice so I'm not going to remember it scene for scene. We're not going to talk about the 50s one. No, but no I didn't even know I guess I didn't know there was one but yeah, sorry, let him continue all your good but  Really like they're trying to like bring them back with these shock paddles. And then he goes in for like this third final push fucking chest cavity opens up and heat. Oh, yeah arms bitten off my favorite part of the whole movie and it looks so gruesome and just gross that's like when shit hits the fan. Yeah, like that's when it gets real nasty because then his fucking head pulls itself off crawls around got to be fucking kidding me.  God oh my God, that's such a good pic Logan. Thank you for that. Thank you for what? Thank you Jamie. What is your pick? Okay, so I picked Sinister eyes from like top to bottom it. I think it's just a really it's a great horror movie. It's one of its one of the most original horror movies. I think I've seen and you know in my life.  Just everything from like the the cinematography to like the soundtrack is Fucking Perfect soundtrack is what sells that movie for me? Yeah, so I think the majority of it was done by Boards of Canada either a band if you can call them that are like a electronic musical group.  Yeah, but they do most of it if not all I'm not sure on that but it's fucking terrifying. Yeah, just if you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about. And if you haven't seen it you need to watch it. Yeah, but uh,  So the whole kind of plot is a true crime writer moves into this house where these murders took place and kind of throughout the movie. He uncovers more these murders took place and they were all recorded on like Super 8 and oil. Yeah. It's like Super 8 film and so as the movie goes on. Well the movie opens with one of them with just us two.  Family being fucking hung just hanging in a tree like so before there's even like like Studio credits or anything like that. It's just like cold country footage of a fucking. Yeah just cold open, you know bodies hanging from a tree. Yeah. It's brutal, which I think was super fucking powerful. Yeah, because that really that really sets the tone for the movie. It sets his bar in place because like in a lot of horror movies, you're like, okay, like what's the  The barrier for them like what will they not how far and they just go you watch kids fucking guy in your life Tom within the first like 15 seconds of the movie. You're like what more can they do to me that can ruin me any more than this moment and it's not even just the one scene. I mean throughout like there's what probably Ford for videos. I think we're six. Yeah, like at least and least for you each one depicts an entire families being brutally murdered.  I won't spoil it in case you haven't seen it. There's a spoiler alert at the beginning of the episode anyway, so it's clear dude, you can talk about it. Okay? Well, I mean the whole whole family gets burned up in the car and then the whole family gets pushed into the swimming pool while they're tied up. You know, it's pretty dark. Yeah. There's a there's the hanging there's the barbecue lawn mowers are the lawnmower that one fucked me up who saw a sleepy time. That's where they get taped to the beds and they slit their throat.  I forgot about I think that's I think that's it. Yeah. Well then the last one but that one doesn't really count but it yeah, but like the thing I liked is so they're moving to this house where the first murder happened where the family was hung and as they're kind of like packing stuff and their attic he finds this box of the it's the movies and it's got like a projector. So like you kind of find out then it's like, oh fuck like  Because he's I think the first one he pulls up his like family hang out or whatever. It was. You know, like okay. We just saw this fucking family get hung and then it's like a pool party and barbecue and like all that kind of shit. And the thing I like is is it that point I was like fuck I want to watch these like right please show them. Yeah. So like as the movie goes on, you know, he watches different one and like it really like builds anticipation because you're like fuck like, please get to the next one because like, you know, you just  You keep seeing how fucked up they get. Yeah, that's a that's a really good movie specifically for like like the Halloween season because like, you know, it takes place in the fall. I believe I think it on their own they're wearing like sweaters and yeah plan on things like that, but just the way like they color grade the movie like in post. It's really cold. It's like yeah, I think there's a lot of greenery. There's a lot of green blue and gray and it's just a cold looking movie. Oh, yeah, I see.  Ethan Hawke's character and I'm like this poor bastard is just going through hell, but damn he does look pretty comfy in that car. You was the same partying for like six weeks in the movie is fucking incredible. It's interesting. I had the cardigan. I think I'd wear every single day like, right. Yeah, dude. I love Sinister. I'll never forget. What was it sophomore year probably my sophomore year. I think it was my 17th birthday party.  It was it was your seven. So yeah, that would have been my sophomore year. It's my sophomore year junior year. We stayed out in your garage in December. Yeah and washed it at your garage is not insulated and there's like none of the garage door was just open. None of us had seen it. None of us have seen it. We just hooked up this like janky-ass TV set up out there and watched it and I remember everybody fell asleep, except me and I was huddled in like the recliner that was in the garage freezing cold while just that.  Just played on the menu just on a loop and I tried to sleep for like an hour and I just said fuck this and I counted to ten and I closed my eyes and I ran from the garage into your house and slept in your bed while everybody else is freezing cold in the garage including you the person whose house. It was yeah, it was what a fucking dick. But yeah, I don't know Sinister is like easily a top five horror movie. It's absolutely super original.  No Legend brutal well-acted. Yeah, we're really good actor. Yeah, super scary. I would definitely heed people because I haven't seen the movie and quite a while to be completely honest. I think it's definitely worth a re-watch though. Always I'm down to watch a movie at least twice a year. It's not even super long. If I remember right? It's not really no wanting our and a half. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't take long as it don't watch it. Don't go horror movie fashion. It's got a shitty sequel.  Yeah, really? Yeah, I never saw the sequel front to back but I've seen like bits and pieces of it and it's just not it's not for me. Yeah, so it's just real quick. Like the sequel is instead of like the parent like the parents kind of like a side plot. It's the kid and like the dead kids are like recruiting the kid to like kill the family. It's fucking weird and they use like the exact same like Boards of Canada music. Oh so like at the height of the  Like at the climax and the original one, you know the fuck. Yeah like that the beat yeah, like they use it again at the climax in the second rate and like honestly it works but you're like really like couldn't fucking find something else for the record just for the record. We're not shitting Boards of Canada. We're not shitting on Boards of Canada here. They make some terrifying music, but they also make some really good music like just clarifying in case anybody what's the name of that album Geo gaudy is I think  I was like gyroscope. Maybe it is I think GRE is the track. I'm just going to fucking listen to it on the way home tonight. So yeah, you do that on those back roads Boards of Canada didn't make music for sinister. As far as I know. I'm pretty sure they just use the album came out in 2002. Well shit, there you go. What is it called shows Gaddy G. Oh God, I think adding that song is gyroscope. Oh, okay. Gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah. And so yeah, they just used. Yeah, uh-huh.  Songs off of that album, but the funny thing is that the song gyroscope which is used in Sinister is terrifying and Sinister, but if you listen to Geo gaudy like front to back it's not like a scary album. It's really nice and kind of beautiful and like you can fall asleep to it. But like just listening to that one track is just horrifying also fucking hack your parents up to. Yeah. I think I think when they did like the music  Mixing I think they added stuff to it is in the actual track of gyroscope. There's not those like disembodied like moaning hell voices on the track, but it is in the movie and that's what scared me and yeah in the movie is those like like this it's terrifying great movie great soundtrack. Yeah watch solid pick. Thanks. Good job. Thank you Alec. What is your pick as far as getting into the field for fall? And  And really getting you know, the feel like Halloween's coming up. This is a total cop-out but I'm going to say the Rob Zombie Halloween movie. And if anyone I know a lot of people are going to hate on that and say, you know, the originals the best one even some of the remakes are better than the Rob Zombie. The Rob Zombie one was again, like the thing it was the first one I saw and even after seeing all the or not  The Halloween's all the employee but the original Halloween. I actually haven't seen the new remake the 28th. Yeah, the 2018 with what's your name? Jamie Lee Curtis. Yeah, Jamie Lee Curtis. I haven't seen that one. But I think that the Rob Zombie one holds up really well against all the other ones but it just really gets you I feel like in the sense of fall because it you know, it starts out pretty happy go lucky. You know, it's got all the Fall colors.  As you know, all the leaves are on the ground everyone's you know dressed up for fall and you know, everyone's just having a good time but equals beating fucking Spy Kids heads in with branches. Yeah, exactly. Don't make fun of my stripper. Mom bitch the kid that plays young Michael. I think I don't know his name does a really good job. I think he's a good actor. I don't think he went on to do anything else. No, but I am talk anything. He was losing hand. He was holy.  And Carl was like God asshole kid in Hancock, and I'm pretty sure he just like Chuck some in the fucking air like a thousand feet. Yeah, and then he gets down and he fucking balls as eyes out. Anyway enough about Hancock. Yeah, that kid was a really good actor and then obviously he's not in it for very long, but I think all its well-acted especially by obviously the kid and  Lori as a teenager did a really good job. I can't think of remember her at her knee. Yeah Scout Taylor Compton and I think that's right. Actually. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, she did a really good job, but you know, I just I just feel like that really puts. You know, that feels like a fall movie. That's a I mean obviously that I feel like it was made for that to feel like oh, let's you know, yeah curl up under a blanket on a Saturday night and watch watch.  Horror movie. Yeah, I appreciate how they add context to the backstory. You know, I mean, it kind of flushes it out a little more than the original where it's like. Yeah, he just keep fucking killed the sister and he's crazy but it shows why he's crazy in the remake, which I really respect you. I respect the movie for doing that and I don't recall on the original. Does it show him kind of growing up in the this Takata?  Just a couple scenes in the mental Asylum. Yeah, I mean there's the one where like he escaped but like he's already like a full-grown adult by that point. I mean, but it doesn't have a scene where he kills the nurse or not. Yeah. I feel like that added to it goes straight from him like getting out of the house from killing his sister to him like basically Escape as an adult escaping its kind of not to like really even say it detracts from the whole ex\",\n",
              "   \"perience of the original but  It is very much rushed like you want to get to like the nitty-gritty of the movie. It feels like mmm. So like I really enjoyed the Rob Zombie's Halloween and obviously, I love the original and I do kind of agree with you that I like the backstory, but I also like the original and there's no backstory like yeah, it's good on both fronts. Yeah. It's just kind of like, oh fuck he killed his sister like, okay, it changes the vibe completely. Yeah, they're there to  Two completely separate movies like yeah, I mean and the general sense in the general sense. Yes, they're literally two different movies, but like the feel and the vibe of both movies are completely different. Yeah. Now my like main gripe with it is like I love Rob Zombie, but like it's overly Rob's. Yeah. It's like he's the Kid Rock of for rides face it it's very grungy that cats not even that it's like, okay. Did they have to be like  You know just shit Hillbillies like they couldn't think there are two big bald dude. Watch. Oh, okay in the beginning there. Yeah when he's not here, he Strode no. No, not Lori. I'm talking like like his like Michael's parents. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. It's see that way in the original know in the original. There's like nothing like a little like a permanently but like yeah and like the remake  Shit, he'll be the dad's a fucking piece of garbage and the mom's a stripper and it's like okay, like I know you're Rob Zombie, but like can you like can you tone down the Rob Zombie? Yeah that Halloween 2007 is one of the very few things in this world that I think that like the original theatrical version is much better than the unrated one. The unrated one has like quite possibly the most graphic.  Unnecessary rape scene in any movie I've ever seen in my life. Yeah, that's it goes on for like 6 minutes and it's really hard to watch and thousands own. Yeah in the in the Rob Zombie one. It's record when he's it's rough to watch. It's really rough and it's just like in the theatrical one. He just like kills them and just get out. Yeah, he just gets out and then in the unrated One Lie, see how he gets out. And yeah, I and so like he gets out because  The two guards like want to like rape a girl in front of Michael Myers to see if they can get my colder Raper to and like he doesn't do it and he just bashes the one dudes head in after you watch him rape the girl for like five minutes and it's just super unnecessary and like hard to watch. I think it let's get I think it shows an interesting contrast because in the original where you know, jack shit about Michael Myers, you're like, he's shrouded in mystery or like he's fucking  I'm spooky. It's like whoa It's like that could be anybody either there could be fucking Cthulhu for all I know you my fucking hurt me ha ha but you know and remit the dog. I'm going to destroy your family. I'm going to surprise I'm gonna fucking cut your head off bitch, but no like in the 2007 Halloween, you know, you see all of these traumatic events take place like just  Somebody get raped in front of him and it makes you like almost sympathize with the Killer and be like, yeah, fuck them up like punch them in the butthole body like fairly certain. He kills the girl that got raped to no. No, he doesn't know. Oh, I thought he did and now he's okay. Well, I do like I tend to not get into horror movies that are just a guy like, I mean, I guess Friday the 13th is actually is kind of just a guy. I mean he's  Kind of got some Supernatural stuff going on more. So later on. Yeah every movie. Yeah a little more deep into the yeah, but Halloween isn't a fall or Halloween movie Halloween the holiday movie for me because it's scary. It's just got the feel. It's got the vibe. Yeah these things but what is what I do like about the Michael Myers character at least in the Rob Zombie one is as like we were talking about you get to see him grow up and he  Treated well in the mental institution like his Malcolm McDowell who also did a really good job in the movie dude comes and you know, it was always, you know, talk with him is always really encouraging and his mom comes and is it as Mom? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah comes and sees him and for a while and you know, he's got a good upbringing in there but he still turns out evil so, you know, he's like he was born evil is a true psychopath and that would that's what this really, you know, I think you know kind of sets them apart from other slashers.  But all I'm it's not a terrifying movie. I think it's just it's just a good movie. Yeah, I think it's good. I'll defend Halloween 2007 linked to the death. I've tell yet a lot of people that fucking hate it. Oh, yeah, I don't get it. I mean, yeah, it's not a perfect time anybody needs but it's still like yeah, pretty damn good. Could it be better? Yes, if you're going to say, you know, not your favorite Halloween I get that if you know, you know your true to the original which is to set a John Carpenter also. Yeah. Yeah, like that's the movie that boom Oh, I thought so if you like the original better, that's fine. But you know  I don't think you can really discount the don't the 2007 Halloween which I haven't seen the new one model know. It's the new one better than 2007. Yeah, it's very good. You'll have to watch it. It's very watch it. Like I saw the font. Well, no, we watched it. We watched it on that day. You got stuck in the snow bank. Yeah, right and I also got stuck in the snow. Yeah, so I cannot I totally forgot I actually have seen it but I don't yeah, you sound like the last half. Yeah, they say.  Stand up pretty close, but I'm still going to stick the 2007. That's my favorite one fun little tidbit fact about about this movie before we move on. Rob Zombie was slated to direct the remake of Texas chainsaw. And for some reason he either turned it down or he couldn't do it and  I'm not going to get super into this because it will save this for another episode but I fucking love Texas chainsaw and I do not super care for the Remake but I really wish we could see Rob Zombie's Texas Chainsaw because that would work with crazy shit hillbilly look brutality all the brutality and they the imagine not that I watch a movie for the Rave scene, but that would be it. Would that make it more in Texas? Yeah. Yeah. Graphic rapes, Rob Zombie's aesthetic is  Crazy hillbilly Nightmare and like Monsters and cannibalism say cannibalism lose, right? That's is Texas chainsaw. So like it makes me sad. It doesn't make me sad that we got Rob Zombie's Halloween, but it does make me sad that we didn't get Rob Zombie's Texas Chainsaw if that makes sense. That being said you just sidebar for a second is that you know, three from I don't know the date it reads out three from hell will be coming out soon. I don't know the date, but I feel like that will be very  Texas Chainsaw like I guess if so, I guess if you wanted to watch Rob Zombie's Texas Chainsaw, you just watched House of 1000 Corpses its kind. Yeah. I haven't seen that but that seems like God similar Chris Hardwick and that movie Rainn Wilson gets hollowed out. Oh, no, that's what happened. Look Sinners removed or it gets like Buffalo a tournament like a fucking Mirvish boy know they like Taxidermy him but cut like his bottom half off and like so like a lie.  Like a big bass like onto his lower half. So we just turns into like a murderer person as like a taxidermied. It's fun plus, you know, dr. Satan. I mean, right what a great antagonist. What a what a great name for an antagonist never see my hero everything I ever wanted right? I feel like we've been on Halloween for a minute so we can move on to Blake's pick here. Thanks. Thanks for for Halloween 2007 a like it's a great pick.  For mine, I'm going to go with Creepshow 1980. Also 82 nice Goodyear Very Good Year actually.  Yeah, I mean what can I say about Creepshow its kind of the movie that ties our friend group together like that. It's kind of it's not individually any of our all-time favorite movies, but it's collectively our favorite movie like very quotable. It's very quotable. It's endlessly quotable. Not a week goes by pre-recorded pre-recorded. He's not a week goes by that one of us doesn't quote Creepshow at least two or three times. The reason that creep show.  Encapsulate Halloween for me is because I guess when I think Halloween I think about like getting together with like a group of people and just like eating candy and like shooting the shit watching horror movies and Creepshow is the all-time greatest get five friends together and eat shitty food and watch this movie and yell quotes at the screen. Like I can't think of another movie that I enjoy doing that.  Umm, or at least for me, it's really not a movie you I mean you can watch good walk by yourself. But why would you not going to be the same? No, watch it by myself all the time. Why are you putting on that? I'm happy that I'm not gonna dog you for it. But I just I could not have to watch it with you. I could like I could watch it by myself. I just don't want to like I want to watch it with my buddies and like, you know, but Delia you bitch bring me my cake. Like I want to yell that at the screen with all shot him.  It's a call. You Billy. Everyone is like fun fact Blake was such a fan of this movie that he actually went as I want to join you are over 40 verily I want is a majority Barrel to win an award for that know, it was just it was it was at like it was at a house show. That was also like a costume Halloween party. I thought you were that so like high school. No, I want it. I want an award in high school for wearing a suit and a horse mask.  I wasn't only brown horse lawyer quick see brown horse lawyer, which I didn't know at the time Clancy Brown was a voice actor for mr. Mr. Krabs. Yeah, not to go on a tangent, but they called over the intercom. They're like second place is Blake Thomas as a Democrat and that's not that wasn't my intention but I got that was not at all what I said, that's not what I had in mind, but I still got a $50 men. She's gift card out of it. So like I'll be whatever the fuck they want. Screw you, dude, but she's rules.  So I'd rather eat cat litter that'll be a Democrat for $50 men. She's gift card and it doesn't matter to me. But yeah, no Creepshow.  It's so good. I mean it's in his it's not a good movie. No, it's a great fucking movie film like the cast is fucking insane it do for 1982 for such a I don't want to call it cheap, but for such like a campy movie like the cast is outstanding especially for the time. Yeah, and some of dancing some people are yeah, some people are just at the beginning of the career. Some people are at the prime of their  Rear like Leslie Nielsen and like how Holbrook. Yeah, and then some people are just getting started. Like I guess Ted Danson probably just be getting what was Cheers Cheers was on before really a tour that I was it. I think I never got into cheers my hunting for the day as I've seen like three up. I thought here's is the shit either way Ted Danson was kind of just getting it was known but he wasn't like world-renowned Ted Danson. Yeah, and then they have, you know, some no-name people.  The that Stephen can I was going to say and then Stephen King makes an appearance as like me only the best bit of the whole movie like that's Up For Debate. I probably have a creep Show episode at some point. Okay. So is it called the cage via great the loads of death of Jordy verrill the crate. Oh, yeah. The crate is my favorite then probably followed by the Jody Barrel.  I don't think Father's Day gets the recognition. It deserves Father's Day spray in my I don't like it and I gotta be honest and my own opinion. I think that Father's Day is the only one that could stand up to itself is like its own movie. I'd like to see that. Yeah, I think that holds true. I I think I've also always been pretty partial to Father's Day. Like I just like how  How just over the top it is like it's so fucking ridiculous. And I also I really really enjoyed the last skit of that movie just really no that's fine. That's Father's Day. But I love the last seen in Father's Day. Okay. Sorry. Well, that's perfect too. But I'm watching is it head Harris? That's in that one watching all yeah and a heretic dance like ants fucking insane.  Wait Ed Harris the debt like no. No, he's one of the kids. He's the boyfriend. Oh, that's right. He's a boyfriend who goes out to check on Aunt Bedelia and get it fucking slam. Yeah. I never it's I guess it's been maybe a year since we watched it, but I didn't realize that was Ed hair also has bear in that movie. I was in yeah, that would be someone who was right at the beginning of their career. Probably he probably was a teenager. But yeah, it was probably in his early 20s. I would say probably he  He dances like an absolute fucking asshole. It doesn't eat it. Every time I see it. I'm like fuck you are or what's that? He's usually a bad guys. Is that a Nightmare on Elm Street movie where the kid is just like pointing aggressively every time I watch Creepshow and you see Ed Harris dance like yeah, it makes me think of that other movie where it's like a kid dancing like with a girl there like in a cabin and he's just like point. No, that's Friday the 13th the Final Chapter I know exactly what  Okay, because I'll come back to that. Um, yeah, the Creepshow definitely I think is kind of like the movie that brings us all together. Absolutely. I feel like we could all go glue that holds our friendship because I feel like we could all go like 10 years without speaking and then just send out like a group text and be like, hey, I'm watching Creepshow at my house tonight and like everybody would just everybody. Yeah sure if we hadn't seen each other in 10 years and I passed Jamie in the  Store, he'd be like pre-recorded. I'll be like yeah, I'd be like pre-recorded re-recording. Send me send me your voice clip. I just want to pretend like you're here watching creepy fell with me. I know you live too far away now and we're old there's there's definitely no movie that I can quote as much as I can creep show. Yeah from the fucking soundtrack. I could I could sit here and like calm have on vinyl I have  Of the original pressing and the waxwork pressing and I also have the Creepshow to pressing and there's also a skateboard behind me and a couple of posters and there's a couple posters upstairs. Yeah, a lot of a lot of Creepshow merchandise in the house also worth noting. We have Blake Jamie and I live together and we have a family crest seal. And on that seal is the see the commercials - oh, yeah, so it's fair to say we quite enjoy.  I create the creepy. Yeah, we're fans Creepshow one hash, its hands of the the Revival that comes out next week on shutter for which I am Creepshow Joey never existed, right? Yeah. Don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, that's what I thought. I really don't know if this is like something you don't want to talk about or if like there really is no Creepshow. Fuck it. We're breaking this there is a creep show three, but it was not made by George Romero and Stephen King It was just like not the one with the blot like the poison.  No, that's to also really solid shouts out to Creepshow to not as great as Creepshow one, but Creepshow to definitely up there Creepshow three was just made by like some dudes who just liked Creepshow which you know, you got to respect like their willingness like we could make a group. She'ii we could probably make a better Creepshow three than the actual Creepshow 3 honestly, I think I don't know George Romero's just a great director. Yeah. That was the the difference in  Quality between just even the first and the second one because George Romero and Stephen King wrote the screenplay for both of them and George Romero. He directed the first one but somebody somebody else directed the second one. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, but it still holds up really well, but Creepshow threes fucking awful. Yeah so fucking bad. It's terrible absolute garbage. It's bad to the point where it's not even fun. No.  A wise or shit? It's not like the room where it's like a terrible movie but it's fun to watch group show three is just you watch it. You get sad like, I just want to watch something else. I was just like I'd rather just watch like blank not another watch TV. You just yeah, you want the fucking bugs to blow out of your chest like an exact leaping up on you. So like real quick. I put myself through absolute hell and I watched like the special features on Creepshow 3. Yeah, come back.  Yo, dude, so fucking it makes me angry that you have a copy of it, dude. Yeah, join the fucking club. I'm really glad that that's not one of those movies. That's like a sought-after DVD. That's like 80 bucks. It's because the worst thing about it is this is not me passing judgment on you, but I I know that if it was you'd probably buy it probably and I would probably support you which is even worse. I know they don't they definitely don't print it anymore. Good. I don't know how much come on I was like, oh sick.  So 2006 really? Yeah, it's always it's bad. It's nine dollars four dollars $4 shipping. It's like not even worth pirating. Like it's that bad. It's shit. It's like the if you were to like hop on Pirate Bay and like snag it like it wouldn't be worth the disk space that it would take up on your computer FBI when they catch you for pirating creepy ethereal like Daisy, what did you do? That's a maximum life sentence. They're like you fucked up. We're not you should have gotten something good. We're not going to give you your  Ten year 250 thousand dollar fine for pirating or just even make you what we're giving you your 10 years in prison 250-thousand dollar fine for pirating this shitty movie. Right? And then after that you're going straight to the firing squad. Yeah or and you're going to watch this movie three and you're going to watch this movie the entire time you're in prison non-stop. Anyway, the special features. There's like some old guy that plays a professor who was like kind of responsible for like that is the  Only bit I've seen in that movie. Yeah, it's fucking garbage anyone notable in that. No, not at all. It's like dark one. I think it was a Canadian movie. I legitimately I think it was just like a bunch of college kids that decided to no. No the two there's two directors and they like did shit before that wonderful. But oh hold on I gets better. So anyway, just real quick in the special features for Creepshow three. There's a like the old guy in the movie The Professor like he's doing an interview.  You know as like himself and he's like, you know, I really have a great amount of respect for the first and second Creepshow. He's like George Romero and Stephen King obviously great writers directors. He's like all that and he's like, but I just feel like there's something about our movie that they couldn't reach like and their potential and I shit you not. I looked at my fucking TV and I looked at it again and I just said fuck you dude. You are a piece of fucking shit. The only the only the only thing that Steven  Can George Romero great dudes had some bombers in their life not gonna lie, they both have some not great pieces of Art and their life. Yeah, they couldn't make a movie that bad if they tried. No. Nobody could nobody could I mean you think about it? It's like Stephen King wrote Tommyknockers. And you know, he was smoking fucking dude. How will we do you ever seen the Langley years all the way Angela?  Here's that should be a whole episode. We'll tell you what we should have a Stephen will hold it to it will have a Stephen King episode. I have a good old laugh about that. But the the two directors for Creepshow three are working on the creeps with TV shows. So that's just that's cool. Well at live like a big part. I think the producers I don't think the\",\n",
              "   \"ced it with like some of the most horrifying tell there's nothing funny about the remade. Oh, that's just God damn Voodoo and Terror from pretty much start to finish. There's really even there's no like break like even  Like in other slashers that really aren't don't have a lot of humor, they'll start light-hearted and then they'll get into trouble but the beginning is let's go into the woods to try and get my brother off fucking heroin, but sister off heroin will shift the opening of the movie is before that. It's the dad burning and shooting his daughter in the face with a shotgun. Oh, yeah, that's right. And they yeah, they cold cold open to that and then it goes to the actual store. They're not like, oh, let's go for a vacation in the woods know.  No, let's go into the woods to try and dry my sister out all for Harrell. And yeah, dude that movie is it's just fucked from start to finish. But yeah, there's enough they don't make any attempt really humor. So and I like that about it even even what you would think they would draw humor from like just like the actual deadites like the demons that they're fighting against in this movie before they would say some really fucking weird shit and you're like, okay I might be able to laugh a little bit about it here. It's just like  Super vulgar and it's like wait. Why did you say that to your brother? Why did you say you want to suck his cock? I don't like that. It's like that's true Terror incest. Oh, yeah Evil Dead the entire series really quick one to throw out saw I was going to sell so all the Saw movies fuck anybody who talks shit on Saul I know there's bad Saw movies, but you know, I'm going to say as someone who's seen all the Saw movies. There's only one bad one and the Saw 3D which is saw five.  I've I think I was good. It's all five. I mean it really wasn't even that bad. But I think that I certainly think there are better horror movies in the sauce here. Oh, yeah, we're all it's seriously like fucking come on. We're really not if you go in if you go into a Saw movie expecting it to be like profound and whatever like and then you come out pissed off that it wasn't like, you know, some crazy like insane, you know make you think horror movie. They kind of are you know, I'm not gonna lie the kind of are there.  The oil theme the overarching story of the Saw movies are the first one is very the first one reminds me of Silence of the Lambs and that it has a very deep lat. Yeah, I mean the plot gets really deep in the you know, there's lots of twists and turns and you know, you have to be paying attention, but the first one definitely if they never would have made a second saw a movie like the the first one would have stood on its own. Yeah, it would have I mean the first ones in  Nothing, like the other ones really there's no the second ones are really all the sequel's really all about the traps and stuff. Yeah, and you know, I'm all about the traps. Oh my God, but sorry, what are you gonna sound bite of that? But yeah, the the soul movies very good. The reason they're this is kind of this is why it's on my honorable mention is because they aren't like Halloween feeling but they always released around like oh, yeah, right before Halloween. They were huge money makers like for the  Between season. I don't know just to me whenever I think so. I think about fall Halloween my biggest gripe taking a big fucking step back with Rob. Zombie's Halloween. Come on, August. Did it really really? No shit? Yeah, dude stupid.  Honestly, I think a lot of them did like the first one I think came out and like September like right before October since you're talking about like release dates and stuff where what a little over a month out from Halloween and there's really nothing slated big to come out. I mean, I know three from Hell comes out at some point. I think it came out yesterday. I think it did a really bad thing. So that would be with you as far as I know. There's not really any huge Halloween like horror movies, that would be weird about him.  Yes, really? Yeah, it'd be weird if it came out yesterday, then we would have to be talking about it. But yeah, there's not like last Halloween the third Halloween remake came out and  Yeah, I need a shit ton of money. Who I really don't think there's anything was when's the new Halloween come out next year. Yeah, 22 million another one. Oh, yes here understated to make three sequels to the new reboot to to do. Oh, well, yeah to how are your pills the next one in than Halloween Ed's is the Halloween kills has such a great title for a fucking movie is what's your name going to be in it? Jamie Lee Curtis is my final honorable mention is going to be a movie well movie miniseries.  Whatever you want to call it that I have not been able to shut the fuck up about for about a month now asking to be Cartoon Network's Over the Garden Wall since we're since we're going to take a hard left out of like R-rated territory into just like a solid PG nice little fun Cartoon Network.  Our long miniseries like in total. It's an hour long hour and a half. Maybe I'd say like hour and 20. Yeah, even I mean it's I watched it for the first time in the middle of summer. And as soon as I got done watching I was like, well, that's just an immediate like Halloween classic. Like I can't wait to watch that every year around Halloween it the whole the whole miniseries is centered around the aesthetic of Halloween. I mean, there's  People made of like pumpkins and like dancing skeletons and the whole movie takes place in fall, and there's a lot of like costume like and fucking folk music. Yeah, dude. It's like Bob Dylan went to see Jack Skellington and it's just a great wrong. Yeah. It's just solid like the soundtrack is really good. It's like the only thing outside of Disney movies that I've ever seen where a character starts singing and I didn't want to just  fast forward like you ever do that you watch like, you know, like something meant for families or kids in a character just starts singing out of nowhere and you're like we can fast-forward through this sometimes I just buy just let's just don't want to do that. You just don't want to do that and Over the Garden Wall because the songs are so good. That's a conversation for another day. We'll talk about Frozen another episode potatoes and molasses.  Possibly the best song to come out of any Cartoon Network anything maybe I was partial to the song that they actually do. It's like the title track. Yeah, the one on the river boat on the river our legs. Its eyes all good-looking love. It's so good. All right Sound by have to find that if they have it on its on Spotify the whole the whole soundtracks on Spotify log. I've listened Avenue worry home. It's so good the whole the whole aesthetic of it like it feels like all the characters are  I based around like what you would imagine a Halloween costume to be especially the two main characters. They're literally in Halloween costumes. Yeah, but she not recognize you will later on I get in till later on but like I don't know it's so good and I cannot recommend it enough. So yeah, those are my picks if anybody else has any last minute like real quick like finger snap ones. Well, since you're talking about like well since you're talking about horror there.  Horror like this cartoon scariness. I'm I'll just throw out the you know Simpsons Treehouse of Horror like the thing like the old when I first started doing it like late 90s early 2000s the thing and I was like actually really scary. Yeah, that one that one freaking out as a kid. Yeah ever feel like that was still freaked me out when he's like you're here, aren't you? And yes bar. I never left you like that.  That's that's terrifying. The my parents got me Simpsons Treehouse of Horror like collection on DVD when I was a little kid and I had never seen The Simpsons before that and so they got me that DVD and I watched it and I'm like for like years. That's just what I thought The Simpsons was was just those episodes. I thought every episode was like that and I had just, you know had a DVD with six of the episodes and I didn't realize that the Simpsons light heart for the most part is  Go wholesome. Yeah, like not wholesome but it's light-hearted satire. And then the Halloween episodes comes along and people are getting like fucked up and like tortured and beaten to death and shit. Yeah, but we don't have I didn't want to elaborate on that - I just want to throw it out there. Anybody else got anything real quick. Fuck it Slither Slither. I've never seen that movie but a rented it on YouTube, please don't spoil it for me. It's fucking awesome. Is it really good sick? I'll watch it tonight. I'll watch it.  Scream scream good one, that's probably going to be it for me unless I mean Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island. That's my last one Cabin Fever live acts fuck we're gonna have to do another one of these episodes next year. Yeah. There's too many like, there's too many good ones. All right. Well, thank you for tuning into dogs with sweaters. I'm Blake. I'm your boy Logan. I'm Jim not Malik. Take it easy.\",\n",
              "   \"ght, huh? That was terrifying. I thought that was like almost like Psychopathic but you can imagine that's and being like everything's fine. She had there's have you seen her mug shot where she's got like the bandages on. Yeah, right and I saw somebody and something it might have been like a word Arena's hang like dress up as  Her for Halloween. It's a long went as her mud truck but such a niche costume. I love it so much. It was like the caption was like yeah. I know I'm probably going to hell aren't I I think they did a really good job. She had the same hair so it like worked but yeah, okay everyone I think you know this that this is another one that we're like you Nana's can't even say that word, you know the mistake. Please forgive me. Just remember the hangover. I've been unanimously.  Yeah, yes. There we go. We've all loved it. I think it's up there with the ballad of Billy walls. I mean, they're obviously very different but I think those are definitely it's up there with being one of the best of the year. Yeah. Definitely. That's how I was thinking about this morning in terms of like what I've actually listen to you this year and what I actually remember listening to because sometimes you just kind of like roll through them and they don't really leave a mark, but I think definitely the thing about Pam is up there. It's also I think a  Really good podcast, if you are kind of like interested in True Crime murder mysteries, but you're not really sure you don't want to listen to something that's massive or there's a new story each week. Like you just want something to just give it a try because I think it's so easily told like the story is perfectly explained. And yeah, I just 10 out of 10 10 out of 10 for me a grade same. So if you want to check out the thing about  Out Pam. It is literally all over the Internet. So have a listen and let us know what you think.  Say the second thing we want to talk about today is a documentary by HBO called I love you. Now die we're going to talk about some pretty strong themes in this one and surrounding suicide and mental health. So if you think you might be affected by those topics, you can always skip ahead but help is always available and we'll put some links on our website. So I love you now die is two-part documentary directed by Aaron Lee car and produced by Andrew Rossi that follows the hearing of a woman suspected of coercing her boyfriend complete suicide Conrad Roy was 17 when he  To a carbon monoxide poisoning in July 2014 after purchasing a generator and bringing the exhaust pipe into his car his girlfriend Michelle Carter 17 at the time of his death is charged with involuntary manslaughter after a series of text messages were discovered which seemed to encourage him to kill himself. Have you guys watched it? Yeah. I haven't seen the documentary but I am so sorry for saying this again. I think it was a dateline episode that I watched. Yeah, there was a dateline episode. Yeah and Evil.  - Avenue. Yeah cool. So the documentary is divided into two parts the first follows the argument of the prosecution and the second of the defense. It takes its time on both parts. It really clearly is of concisely sets out the information and it's interspersed with interviews from family and friends of comrade Michelle and her family refused to be interviewed for the documentary. So the case and the like the legal part of the matter of pivoted on the text message the text message exchange between war and Carter During the period immediately.  A prior to his eventual death at one stage. He exited the exhaust fumes field Carr & Carr told Carter told him to get back inside the judge ruled Carter guilty as when he exited the car. He comrade quote broke the chain of causation and quote and then her messages encouraging encouraging him to re-enter the vehicle constituted. They call it wanton Reckless Behavior, which left her liable to be found guilty of the charge of involuntary manslaughter. I think we all made like our own  Judgments about Michelle and I think the Ferocious media coverage of it also did they, you know, there was Constant Comment on her appearance and her facial expression, but this documentary really goes deep into the background of both of those teenagers that are bringing their struggles with mental health and their relationship. And as that goes on of a different picture kind of develops one of our abusive relationship relationship with a Moni met around five times yet. Most communication was through text message one of two.  Ages with severe mental health issues, one of the girl with eating disorders. He'd self-harmed and was chronically lonely lonely begging for a friend and who begged her boyfriend not to harm himself in the beginning of their relationship. He previously attempted suicide on more than one occasion even being hospitalized as a result. I think it really brings into Focus mental health and the disconnect between a text message and saying something to someone's face I think in the documentary, there's actually an expert explains that there's almost like a  Association through text message based through a text message based relationship as if you can't fathom another person being at the other end of the the device. So you say things that you like never say to someone's face the documentary is really heartbreaking on a number of points, but I found it to be an expert mix of empathy and harsh reality great editing visual effects. They ping a lot of the text messages like up on the screen. Yeah, that was really good and it was so it was like a I think it's remember it took place, but it's  Now you're saying like this is like Landscapes and they would have like the messages like pop up on like either side of the screen. It was really really well done. I think it makes it a really sort of like worthwhile watch and definitely more of a worthwhile watch if you formed an opinion on the case because there's so much more information unbelievable the Dateline episode. I just I remember it because it was such a different story like it's not did the typical murder mystery, but I do remember that episode being very much centered on how  how could she do that? She's evil and that was kind of the narrative at least from what I remember that she coaxed him into doing this that he really changed his mind part way through he wanted he didn't want to do this anymore want to stop and she was the one that put him back in the vehicle, but it died from what I remember. It does not dive into any sort of thing that she was going through or any sort of mental health on that side. It was very much, you know, she's done this.  In the end the first part of the documentary, you definitely get the cheese. She's obviously obviously because it's the prosecution's side. She's not paying too well and she does seem like she has some severe issues. But again, that could be the editing. It could be the way you see it. You're not getting the whole picture that the way she behaved after he died where she was just like eating up the attention that she received and it make it seem to become about her. It was a bit odd like she organizes the baseball game.  Seems like your hand but organized it at her house, you know, that's what I like where she lived in the town. She lived it and stuff like that. I really like how they swerve did it where they did paint like both sides like they did give you because that's the biggest biggest thing. We allotted like true crime documentaries. It's always there's always an agenda the person making it has an agenda like there is always, you know, yeah they have time in that they want. Yeah, it's entertainment exactly and they want to show their side of what  They believe I mean you just watched making a murderer and you can you know what? I mean, it's going to all be told in a way that is you know, that sort of thing. So I thought it was really good that they did it a bit differently there and it seemed almost a bit more fair funny enough when I was finishing up on this and I was like typing this up. I was like scrolling through Facebook to look for for an article, which I didn't find and I got another news story about a similar kind of case.  Oh shit. So it's again happened in the US and in I think the hips 2019 in young u21 is charged with involuntary manslaughter after her boyfriend Alexander you tala sorry if I messed up he completed suicide 90 minutes before his graduation commencement Sarah too symmetrical left his graduation commencement ceremony. This case might be a bit different as she was apparently on the roof of the parking garage where he fell to his death.  Oh my God back in this case highlights. There was 75,000 text messages between the couple 47 and 1/2 thousand of them coming from her and the Suffolk County District Attorney's office is quoted in the press conference. The indictment alleges mrs. Misuse Behavior was wanting and Reckless and resulted in overwhelming. Mr. Utah as will to live and that she created a life-threatening conditions for him that she had a legal duty to alleviate. So it's like I'm really interested to see  This one goes as well after watching that one. I think I saw something about this to unlike on like a article of I think some people are like, well, this is like a dangerous precedent that you can be. I mean, I don't know anything about that case. I just saw some people were like, whoa, it's going to get a bit out of him. But then I guess that's what like manslaughter is though, isn't it? Like yeah, you're not. Yeah, how much of a legal responsibility do you have? Michelle Colter was found guilty of it. You know, she had a I think it was a  Twenty-One months sentence which was reduced to 15 months. She's halfway through her sentence now, but it's just like you are culpable for that yet. That is it like you're responsible for your actions. You can't you can't teleport you like you can't tell someone who's in a car trying to kill themselves to then get back in the car. That should be illegal. I think people complaining on the internet saying that this this might you know open a can of worms. It's one thing to have an argument say with somebody through text.  Or what have you but it's a very other thing to tell someone I think you should end your life. You should get back into that. Very dangerous situation is you should die now. Yeah is it's very fact that right or wrong thing, which I don't think maybe she didn't understand that Michelle called didn't understand that but I don't know this seems to be a I think there's with her. Yeah, it seems like okay cuz she did tell didn't she tell  All her friends a few days before he did it that he had done it or something like that. Like she had she's like the attention that she wanted. Yeah. I think she said that I think he's killed himself. I can't get hold of him. And obviously one of my friends were like clamoring around her but then when he did kill himself she did that again and she was just like alive, you know, I can't get hold of him. I can't you know, he's not picking up the phone and it said that at that point she knew he was dead. Yeah, she already knew and then there was another point where she she told one of her friends.  I think it's my fault. I told him to get back in the car. I think it's my fault. It is your fault. Yeah, it is it's heartbreaking, but I think it's very well put together documentaries great. I definitely recommend definitely recommend it. I'd give it like a four out of five. Yeah. I think I agree. I think I'd say definitely a four out of five. It's okay. It's worth a watch and it's a bit different than like I said, a lot of other True Crime stuff is and it's just not the same sort of thing either. It's adult.  That's just a whole different sort of case than your the Glad say we don't normally with watch a documentary about weird Crime Time. Say this week for weird crime time. I'm taking you to Chorley in Lancashire, which is a little bit Northwest of Manchester to meet Stephen Gaskell who got into a bit of a trouble on the 5th of July 2019. So the head up the headline from the Lancashire post is dancing Charlie flasher balance to pile on head before exposing himself at  Junction all right, okay that there's a lot to unpack there and it's about so to Boone was standing outside Lake look tutions when they spotted Steven acting strangely. They noticed he was pacing up and down and then he began dancing after he'd finished dancing. He pretty proceeded to try and balance a pie on his head. He then dropped his trousers and exposed his genitals when he noticed me when I was it like, I mean, it was a really good pie. No, I didn't enjoy.  It's got to be an apple pie apple or apple and rhubarb maybe yeah, she business not like a meat pie. I don't even think that well, it's pornography. Is that a pie - yeah. I mean, I might never know. I mean it depends on how good the pie is so when you notice the women were watching or I like to call it the pork pie pervert pulled up his trousers and walked away. I don't know if it was a pot pie. It just sounded funny. Oh, no, although denying the charge of exposure with intent to cause alarm and  Dress he was found guilty by Preston magistrates courts. So the penalty for exposure with intent to cause alarm and distress is actually pretty severe he could face up to two years in prison. All the requirements assigned to the sex offenders register for two years. He was due to be sentenced on the 26th of September by can't find any update. So hold on the pork pie pervert could potentially serve more time in prison than the girl from the manslaughter. You should kill yourself in the car case.  And my dad, yep, the flashing your dick. Oh woman which you know is is section. So like really true. Yes. Yeah, but it's okay. You can just take it as text your boyfriend to go kill himself. So I was thinking what would his punishment be for this? Should he be forced to abandon support Pony's head and walk through the town. I was like Searcy. Yeah, but you must Game of Thrones style. Yeah, but the ladies he flashed a pilot says sorry I flashed you or be forced to only eat Fray bentos pies for a year.  That's why I've been wondering what flapper party hasn't he said now, I know because a poor I've been a pork pie is pretty like readily available you get pulled by. Yeah, but if it's like a big pie, would you balance that on your head? And I know you could drop that if you drop tap, I'd be really sad exactly. I don't know if he was really considering the pie at that. I mean if you're dancing kind of like in the street and you think you know, what would really complement this dance putting something on my own?  It reminds me of back to last week. Was it last week? That's Florida man. And the yeah the catfish. Oh, he pulled out his book up. Yeah, like their life is how you get it. Like what's happened hypnosis. This is what I'm saying. I want to know what happened three hours before this incident. What were you doing? How did you get to this point? It does make sense. If it was a pork pie. You could probably have a couple of those in your pocket you can get rid of so, you know, the small ones. Yeah.  Yeah, because in my mind I'm thinking like an apple pie, you know that grandma made but then he would be you know, how do you transport that easily? Exactly. Do you know what this reminds me of as well not that Veer off subject, but you guys remember the Swiss cheese pervert. Yes. So so I was trying to I was trying I was trying to move away from like trying to get away from animal crimes, which I know where are they now in tag food Chrome, so  Yeah, exactly. So like there's that the guy that was really turned on by swiss cheese. Maybe we should have like second segment a month among the round of war crimes and one for food Chrome. Yeah. Okay.

Anchor anchor is everything you need to make a podcast in one place. They distribute your podcast for you. They have tools that allow you to record and edit everything right from your phone or computer. It's free the even allow you to put ads in your your podcast. It's pretty awesome. Go check it out download the free anchor app or go to Anchored off dot f m-- to get started. Okay, let's get back to the show.  Today's words are fatuous, silly and pointless apocryphal.  Of doubtful authenticity, although widely circulated as being true usually in regards to a story or statement a credit e having an acrid smell accurate is having an irritant Lee Strong and unpleasant taste or smell angry bitter.  Trench in see in size of - keenness and forcefulness of thought or expression or intellect euphony the quality of being pleasing to the ear, especially through a harmonious combination of words.  Trump trump Trump trump no matter what you think of him. You got to admit. He's very entertaining especially when it comes to his tweets.  A lot of his tweets are completely fascists. Remember the the whole kafei tweet where he tweeted a word that said Kofi. I like 2:00 in the morning unbelievable. Basically all of his tweets are trenchant. He's very bold once everyone to listen every once in a while though. He'll have a rather euphonious comment. I assume those pleasing tweets are in by his professional speech writers right now is impeachment trial is  Underway, some say is conversation with Ukrainian president clearly frames it but others say it that is apocryphal. We'll just have to see what happens.  That's all for GRE vocab. We wish you guys the best of luck if you're taking the test this week.  Also, if you wouldn't mind leaving us a review the be much appreciated. Thanks so much. See you next time.\n"
