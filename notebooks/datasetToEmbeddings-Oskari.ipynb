I know almost nothing and Cal knows very little but that doesn't stop us from acting like we got the Sports World all figured out usually this leads to us making lots of mistakes. But this week we had our first guest Joe Milo and he talked so fucking much. We even have a chance to mess anything up. Don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. We can like line them all up. You dance like toughen the honking. Thank you. Got one two, three. What's up spins Sports Network ins even come up with a name for our fans yet. I think you have to have sporks three three digits worth of fans before you can nickname them. We're here with our first ever guest. Give a warm. Welcome to Joe Joe. What Joe? No speed you could listen all six if we I did I did even though it seems the second one first. So I just finished it and the first one I just finished that in the car ride as well. Thank you so much. Joe has a fresh. I'm a farmer. Yeah former hockey player played low-level D3 hockey. No big deal should have played a really crappy D1 school, but I chose education good for you because I knew I wasn't  Making it no dad and I was like a similar story. Yeah, I was just going to say I knew we would have something to talk about because I played hockey but it sounds like even more tangibly. I went to Columbia to play a shitty D1 basketball and made mistake you didn't make because I could have started at three or four d three schools as a sophomore and I was so public school that I wanted to talk shit and tell everyone I played D1.  I quit after eight games. Yeah, because no I quit senior year though because my coach I heard my hurt myself. My coach was a fat bastard. And yeah, he was like you're going to play on the fourth line. I was like, I'm first like or I'm not playing but what school are we talk tough? Okay tough and he was like, okay deal your there's like you got yourself a deal. See you later. You got hurt the second game at Middlebury big big hit. I heard concussion tore my need tore ligaments my  Hand want to hit one his who was playing Draymond Green. I was knocked out cold on my knees. I look up there's 30 seconds left in the period. I struggled to get to the bench buzzer Rings we go to the locker room. I have no idea where I am. I started the next period did you really I did was that like your choice or that was like some sort of like well tough back in 2008-2009. Nobody really asked you if you were dead.  That you know, like you took you take that test before the season I so you like see how smart you are at the beginning here. And then if you get take a big hit for supposed to be like you need to take this test again, right see how dumb you are now and everybody just dumbed it down the first test. Oh cooking the books. Yeah, so that no matter how hard you got hit you could play know. I was probably knocked out five six times during my college career like knocked.  Out out damn never stopped playing a little level protective. It was only after every time CTE in the NBA in the D3. Could NCAA a short time span left to play. I'm just gonna keep going. Yeah, just like I'm sitting here with a torn ACL just had surgery tort first one of my trip ski for four more days. I mean look, this is Ashish. First of all before we move on if anyone wants to know what that incredible sound.  Song was that we just started seeing we have a country song about the future when it's 2050 and all the NBA players are all like LeBron. So that's all it's just so big and strong and fast that it's like dying possible to score you just run into each other and it's called CTE in the NBA when the shot stop dropping the head start knocking in the shot stopped.  Marshawn Lynch playing foot basketball right there. No equipment. Just big massive animals to yeah, it sounds wrong each other. It sounds like that's your general approach to life as you're here. I was a very physical human. Yeah. Yeah. Alright so Tufts D3 and the reason that we are here together with you now is because that makes you a hockey expert and down I so far have focused on the NBA's  Pretty much exclusively talking about the NBA and it's the Stanley Cup. We are on gate. We're coming up on a game seven these oh, hey, we need the authority. I went to college in Boston. So I've connection there. Yeah, and I went graduated high school and st. Louis. Oh shit. Yeah. So who's your who's the horse horse horse for sure everybody from Boston hate everybody. Yeah, great. I'm all deaf. Well buses sports fans are tough breed of people to yeah, like and I think that they wear that as a badge of honor for them, I think.  They're just so annoying Jessica. No, I mean look if we'd even without that the st. Louis has never won a championship. So this is a fifty-first season is that yeah, 49 seats of the storyline is where I don't know. Yeah. Well, that's okay 1970 1971. Yeah, that is 73 now, you know suddenly, you know, they still well they had a what's the story? There's a story here though like  The broom was the priest to beat the st. Louis Blues in the Stanley Cup finals that Famous Bobby or photo where he's flying through the air that was game seven against the saying and they never recovered. They've had some nasty teams. Yeah. I haven't won anything. No. Yeah, they had they had rennick right at one point. I don't know if it is as good as need a goaltender Chris Osgood. Yeah, come on, it was on Detroit and st. Louis. Yeah, but whose team you're talking about Chris Pronger was on  The team at all was no bread. No, that's big Wayne Gretzky for your red hot red hot. Will you might need to put your phone on do not disturb. That's also this point in the recording Joe's girlfriend called rookie mistake three words, Joe Milo do not disturb. Okay. So we're talking about great Blues teams grand hall the obvious choice and you went straight to get to you. They had four year to me. Holly Gretzky our contemporaries grant fuhr Grand Prix gold brother. Yeah. Well tender. Yep. Yeah one of the first black guy  Total to really be a star. Yeah, I was I was curious about was watching game six here tonight. And I was I didn't ask the guy that I was sitting with because I didn't want to make it sound like I was ragging on hockey. But what do you know what the like how what percentage of the league is is non-white? Oh and there's one guy on the Caps. There's probably there's almost a guy on every team now, really? Oh, yeah. There's a couple tees with two or three guys. Really, I mean it so you have to think  I'll run Canada lets anybody from french-speaking places into Quebec. Okay. So there's a lot of Africa that's French Amanda pay phone call phone and they let them in no-questions-asked. Like that's Canada anybody could go live there basically. All right, and I spent two years in high school there as well in Toronto. Well and from the most diverse city in the world may be diverse. This is incredible.  As of a few years ago. Yeah, that's still the it's incredible. Totally. I love Toronto more than like anywhere else. Yeah, and everybody's just so nice. You just moved at Ronnie become a nice person. That's incredible. But America lies so so cuddly. I'll be care so much and all these really intelligent people from Africa or come and move to Canada. Right and they make something of themselves and their kids are Canadian their kids become PK Subban. He's on Nashville. He's one of the best  Offense in the league. What do you thinks gonna happen in game seven? We got we got them five and oh in the playoffs after a loss and there are like nine and their 82 on the road, which is unheard of in the playoffs. Yeah, there's five six if they win. They would be the only team like to ever win a cup with a losing home record. Okay. Well interested, let's Circle back if you are familiar. Usually the worst to First is you  Initial season and you're the worst team and then the next season you win the championship the blues current worst to First situation is inside this season as of January 3rd, they were the worst team and and on January 7th the goalie that they're using in the playoffs made his professional debut. So he's another guy. I think I saw seven and two and he's played for the Bruins farm team last year drama. I want to put this  this this for the nuns hockey fans and put this in perspective for people January is for this was 45% of the season was behind them. So that's as though that's like if the team that was in the last place in wonderful in the middle of October won the Super Bowl. Yeah, basically, oh, yeah the worst record in the NFL in October wins the Super Bowl that's not even goes the simple and pretty unbelievable actually not possible.  Then FL you get the you get to the playoffs if you were owing 7. Yeah, just yeah, if you one the right one out if you want out and then they had a fight in practice with ourselves with two of two players just on the same team on the blues. They fought they were in last place in the whole league. They had a fight in practice and it's supposedly they all went out together afterwards and that's where they heard the song Gloria. Yes, the Glorious story and yellow riaa. Yeah.  Yeah, Gloria and I want that they play that song. That's the Wind song now, they went out together bonded as a team and Philadelphia and they heard the song. We were there. It sounds like your kind of party know it. I mean he was there he was hammered so I can't remember.  It's actually sort not unlike the NBA the NBA finals of though. I do want to talk about that a little bit to the Bruins are like you cannot root for them. Even if you don't have an opinion about Boston or the people there or the Boston sports fans just discussed the blues story. It does not get more obvious that literally unless you own a bar Bruins Jersey if you're rooting for the Bruins, you're a narc. It's like you you cannot see what's happening and want St. Louis to lose whether it's  it could have been the first Stanley Cup in history and they were the best team in the league. You still have to root for them. It could be the they were half as bad as they are any part of the story. It just it's screams rooting for the blues. And so do you think they're going to pull it off? I think it is going to be one of the best games of hockey I've ever watched. Okay, it's every hockey players Fantasy game seven Stanley Cup finals every single one of these guys has dreamed about this their entire life.  And like when you're in the driveway taking shots, yep, but that little with the pipe pipe pipe net goal. He's not talking about their shots of tequila. By the way. It normally is what he's talking about snaps Flappers. Yeah, whatever bar down. You know, it's got to go top cheese what you know where your mom comes out and she's screaming at you for breaking another set of garage door. Yeah. I went through six pairs of garage doors. My mom did wow. My mom did not like that.  Here is the same. Yeah, I missed a lot. I guess that's why I didn't go to 1D three-car garage. No, I think they just want to keep my head small. But yeah, the gain is going to be I bet you it goes to overtime supposedly the ice in Boston is terrible and that's why they're having a hard time at home. I heard say about the he starts to melt right? You know what I've played on so many shell ranks and some are just  MSG worst ice I've never played on it because they have so much going on there. They have a basketball then playoffs. They have concerts. They're constantly playing with floors down for over the ice say like nothing's happening. So it's supposedly the Bruins lead fast ice not their game. There are very fast team and the ice is just no good and it's slowing them down and that's a bad thing, but they have to Grass. Yeah, they were 250 career ask, who's he?  He's not even if they lose he still win MVP. So this is good and Boston hates him because they think he can can't get over the hump and they can't win the Bollywood ragging on him for years. Yeah, and now they're all going to be like if they win their get on the bandwagon too because the greatest thing in the world, but that's Boston. This is because it comes back to what we talked about last week. You're saying that in the NHL  Playoffs they have an MVP for the whole playoffs for the playoffs and they have a Stanley Cup finals MVP. No. No, so just the flat playoffs and it is it always the winner of the Stanley Cup. It's generally the winner. It's generally the winner because I mean that you're saying that's what makes you the most valuable right is that you want you're saying but I'm saying if you are so good that he could even it's happened before even if they lose he on it maybe maybe a couple times. But if they lose I still think he can win it. Yeah. We looked it up for the NBA after last.  And the only time it ever happened was Jerry West and it was like the first year they gave it and that's because like he's obviously the logo Surprise close, right? Well friendly maybe a handjob friendly none of them friendly and unfriendly friendly true, you know, give him the old Jerry West over the pants, but that would be really interesting if that happened. I like that. I like the idea of some sort of like extremely  Active award-giving whatever this is. This is the ideal. Fuck you Boston scenarios that Boston losses, but they still got their degree. But Rask who they've been clowning for years still gets the MVPs also like City would go Bonkers. Yeah, there were some right they would throw cars foot cars over. I mean, there'll be right spot. I think that it's like a Dunkin Donuts closes. Oh my god. Well this 8 and 2 Blues road record has convinced me that they're taking game seven of this is going to be  It's gonna be good stuff. I hope so man. I hope so too. Yeah, I think the blues are going to when like 3-2 in overtime. Yeah. Yeah. So right now the average goals in the NHL game 7 for total. Yeah Dennis with shoot at folks should everybody she got some reading material. Uh, everybody definitely turns on their defense like nobody wants to be the guy who gets scored on totally my game 7 of the fire - it was super sad. Everybody's stiff. Did I want to ask you this though? Let's talk about Sin.  Allure question about about fan favorite. So we entered the end NBA Finals obvious from our first two episodes that we were rooting for the Raptors and that in last episode. You guys know Aubrey count very close with Aubrey count made it baby the case that the entire audience was sort of raptors friendly the great story about kind of the cannon has in it and  I the whole story with him leaving the team and coming back from injury everything about it. I agree. I think rooting for the wars like we discussed is kind of like rooting for the Patriots this point. You can't run from Dynasty. Plus they have like the Voltron like free agency robot team, but I think the injury to KD has the storyline change the entire Paradigm not it's not going to sway me because I cannot root for the worse, but I think that the sympathy and like the sort of emotional component that  I've witnessed in the last 12 hours since he went down the new injury, not the original injury to statistic this your just watch that in slow-mo the trying to come back and getting and bawling out for a while and getting hurt. It was almost as if suddenly you had a reason to feel something and all for The Words, which you just usually would not and I really wonder how many people are like as committed to the Raptors as they were a week ago. Well that coupled that coupled with the fact  Other Raptors fans. Cheered. When was that when he went down? I think that maybe can I just make one Bostonian long as they can make just one did you if you see the picture of KD when he is down holding his ankle. Yeah Wayne Gretzky sitting right there really in the picture of Wayne Gretzky see right there. He is not cheering. He knows exactly what's up. Yeah so bad. Yeah. I mean what a photo talking about the hockey episode. Yeah Gretzky was  Like a Jordan like it was like if everyone would be like well, it's hockey so they wouldn't like really give it props. But he was doing sort of similar things as Mike and you don't get until you basically Jeter maybe another Sport and then maybe back even LeBron the consistency of the Championships. We don't really have so how many files is a brahmana to like, that's not unheard of right? There's no again. Today's era were it's a different time just like hockey. The goal is didn't do butterflies.  And they were just always standing and they would do these kick saves like you watch some of the clips. It's like there's no gold typing. Right? Right, right, but that's still open Gretzky era. Oh, yeah, like you don't stop coal tenders were great. Don't get me wrong. But two pads were tiny, you know, you weren't allowed to hit Wayne. You were not allowed to touch him. What do you mean? Somebody would take a baseball swing at your head just one and today you can't there's no  you can't there's no reason you don't need to protect anybody because nobody's really doing that stuff. Anyway, there's no big fights. There's no line brawls. Yeah, like there was a guy on Wayne's line everywhere. He went that if you toss away and you're going to get fought that doesn't that just doesn't happen anymore if that's why he Crosby gets hurt. That's why stars get hurt today the Stars big time you have to I mean if you want to win you gotta the stretchy. So why why why they stuffed with the the bodyguards?  Because they're trying to get fighting out of the game completely different thing to well. They just disallowed The Bodyguard and a lot of people just don't want to pay a million bucks to a goon. Yeah, you know, I mean without a job is to kick the shit out of your star, you know, you want three guys online playing their best hockey. Yeah, you know you want three stars on that first line. You don't want a star a good guy and then a really bad guy who's just only there it's a favorite activity.  So much since then you can't take anything away from his accomplishments because he's had over to 2600 points. Right but which will never nobody will ever come so you're saying but not Jordans Jordan look guys. I for Jordan's are before Jordan. I think Jordans are he's the beginning of these the beginning because I think Jordans is more important than LeBrons because now you're not allowed to touch anybody in basketball and  Jordan's are it was rough. It was rough. That was that was game is playing Dennis Rodman, right? That's what I'm saying. Like I think basketball is going in the wrong direction hockey's going in the right direction. Wow, so, you know, like the way that the ways that like I was watching the game the other night and Steph jumps into another guy. Yeah and gets the foul created this three-point. It's you're allowed to land rule so you can to Landing Zone. Yeah, how can you jump on somebody?  And he gets the foul. I will say I think there's no it's a terrible week. There's no other there's no other competition from the other three Sports in terms of their relationship of the referees to the truth. Yeah, like in baseball. It's like there's not a bad call here and there in terms of the strike zone right and then they like freaked out and then they go away and the night maybe we might call the next 84 times because he's not he's not in anyone's pocket NFL  We've had the terrible call the Saints call. Obviously, my point is no one thinks that the actual hump and the player have something in the in them that they could have built in the NBA that the players invite the rest into the game in a way that they don't in other leagues is that we're saying no I'm saying it's corrupt the way that someone gets a call like that you're describing that does go back to Jordan because he was the best and I don't know what t\",\n",
              "   \"he psychology of it is or whether it's their ability to talk.  Talk to the ref better or what it is or the assumption that since they're great. They couldn't possibly have done something wrong the idea that like Jordan got three steps instead of two or that LeBron gets a lot of calls that is specific to the MBO. It's don't compared to the other lesser. The NFL is so egregiously guilty of that. It's I mean, it's that's that's a headline literally every single fall is there you get their star quarterbacks, who if you Corey got them wrong if you don't put a pillow down.  Sack them you get penalized and even then we're back there. Maybe they have to Camp Cam Newton. They're getting can't let me get penalized. If you don't lead with your helmet. It's that's true. I think that that is a just quarter patently false. Largely quarterbacks, but our backs are the stars quarterbacks are the Steph Curry money guys, aren't you have to protect them to feel that they're the face of this thing because the guys are making twenty thirty nine dollars a year. Yeah. Well, that's what you that's what you're describing with Crosby and these guys they don't have that right so there.  So they get play against the third line fourth line and cross. He's gonna get a concussion here and there. I mean, that's just where these guys are going to hit you but you like it overall in the NFL but will be applied that to the NFL and those guys were getting knocked out. That would be bad. Well, I think just like their quarterback. I mean these guys are getting blindsided by animals. These guys are freaks of nature. There are hugely that they're fast. They're the strongest guys on the planet and they're hitting you  When you're not looking yeah, yeah. I mean that's what you got to protect the sports we talking about but the but complaints about the NFL getting soft are giving credence all the time and I'd Health but I figured yeah, like I've heard so many guys committing suicide lately like you they have to do something but but it didn't do people complain about the NHL being  soft and does it do we just don't have guys it's very rare that you hear a hockey guy doing these kind of things but we just don't for some reason we just don't have the brain issues as much as NFL has it been since CTE and NHL for sure there's I mean, what's his name? Bob Probert? He was a big fighter. Yeah. I'm I'm Red Wings. I'm pretty sure they studied his brain because he was addictive drugs.  He fought a thousand times like put this there's no right glove. Thank God is like these are Big fists getting hit in your face. Yeah, you're going to have problems with your life. Yeah, and he died. He died. I think he killed himself pretty sure. Yeah, and I mean, yeah, there are definitely links to hockey and CTE just not at the same rate. There's so many more football players and they do things.  He's in practice like the Alabama drill like where you're just Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Oklahoma where you're just going head-to-head right head-to-head. And for how many years were they doing that record over and over and they wanted you to hit each other's heads. Yeah. I mean every single play right is a is a minor head injury at best right even no matter what position you can't accept him. He really move your head in those helmets. Like you can't like turn your head to get your head out of the way. Really? Yeah. I mean, I'm the guy  Bodies is you're going to hit your head? Yeah hockey there used to be way more hitting and now they're still ton of headache. But I think they've done a really good job of anytime anybody gets close to the Head. We're like Cliffs a guy's head. You're getting suspended. So guys are really thinking about it guys are really looking not to get suspended because that you lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in your paycheck. Right? Like that's hockey players for the most part are making NFL money. Yeah.  Yeah, there's a lot of yeah, okay, that's kind of apples and oranges. It's all right. There's a lot of different there's a lot of very big hockey. I don't think they'd said that there's a connection in public like football where people made them. Yeah. They tried not to say it. Right. Wow, right they put they had to say it eventually and hockey still hasn't said it but they're doing literally everything they can to like limit it mmm. It's that you can't it's an aggressive sport basically in every other week is better on every  Shoo, LF L make a the plantation put it but it's your choice to be there your your choice when you're a kid like you fall in love with Huggy. I don't care. I never cared. I just want to play hockey. I knew exactly the risk. Yeah, we knew about concussions. Like I knew I could potentially get messed up. I had concussion problems in 8th grade and the doctors were like, you should probably quit hockey. I'm like, I'd rather die, right so I continued to play hockey.  That's funny because I played hockey from when I was probably eight until when Washington Jr. Caps. I was on the month. I was on the Montgomery Blue Devils. Okay. I I quit as soon as checking was introduced. So we have opposite stories again. I list the - once checking right was skating backwards was not my strong suit compared to skiing for it. So if and it  You can't skate backwards. You're pretty much a sitting. You're you're you're having a tough time out there. Yeah, I mean I could skate backwards, but that moment where you turn but then from front to back stop. What did you just kind of like, you're just very exposed. Yeah. I was like, okay full-contact, like wasn't my thing. It was my first yeah. Yeah, we can tell by your knee brace Joe. I love it. Let's talk about some of the drivers are going to win Raptors. Are you? Okay? Yeah. It was way too Raptors with  Everyone's happy and it felt season starts. Yeah, because he'll get paid that 31 million option Max and he's the team has demonstrated that they do need him and and the GM cried that jam cried. He got cut he got his season got cut short this year at the worst time. I think that there are a lot of compelling emotional arguments and financial Arguments for  Did he think he can just sign that one year option? Okay any more than here? Right and he gets like thirty 1 million bucks and he gives his rehab all year and not playing just get paid. Yeah, I was talking to Buddy that said because my reaction was when I saw the GM well first when during the game they cut to the sideline reporter and she said there's a lot of raw emotion back there right now. So they're not going to show us and then she goes and the Agents back there and the owners back there and I was  during would buy raw emotion. Does she mean someone's getting cursed out because of the decision to put that the decision to play was made or are they morning? It didn't make sense the idea that it was like what are they trying? So obviously it turns out it may be that the injury was more severe what that just the cat sound like was very quiet was my like if it was what I heard but it was an Achilles would they have actually put them out there? I don't think so. Well, this is the thing. So then they cut to then you cut to the GM crying and saying he's gonna take the blame and again I ask myself what why why are they?  Talking about it like this. Did they force him to play? So I asked my buddy who's who actually had a similar injury. And first of the first guy said they mentioned before the game not a nikhil no risk of Achilles injury guarantee. They said that and which is like it's super kind of a tell it my book. It's like why are you bringing that up? And now it happened that specific pretty specific and then apparently the calf injury can sort of Disguise and achilles problem and  and almost the weakness exposes the other body part. So in a sense like it might have been a gateway to an Achilles injury in which case it was a bad decision. Even if the calf was cleared potentially. Maybe you think that you think that you who you blame the Golden State staff and you think you should not but there's three games left. I think it's the finals pretty obvious. We should have been out there if it was a hockey player.  I can't open his mouth. Yeah on the ice is a broken jaw think that guys taking a day off. No, right and you need when you played hockey you're huffing and puffing that mouth is coming open you need that oxygen he is playing and everyone is talking. Oh, he shouldn't play they're going to take him out. He's having a hard time out there and it's his call. He's a star. He's there Captain. Mhm. Well what I was saying, I don't necessarily blame the organization if it's they can't force him to play at the end of the day. He's  he can sing. No, he's There's No Deal on track do anything is no contract that forces them to they might have cleared him erroneously. But the point I was making was I wonder if what you're describing which is this idea of your basic talking about mainly knit manliness and like toughness and there was things that were in the press and you got the anecdotes about Draymond Green like saying they can venture out him and bitching about the injury and it's like just Draymond even have the fuck.  In for information if well, that's that's a bit of an oh that's been mischaracterized characterization that the fishing was like five months ago the injury they've all been bending over backwards to be Pro KD KD. So competitive Katie back when you can come back and that's not really maybe there's a maybe there's maybe like the medical staff clarinet play is in a way like a subliminal push towards the court for a player who probably already wants to get back out there, but the I don't think you can say that  Like any player or coach publicly questioned Cadiz toughness or his commitment to the team or his necessity to the team during these playoffs. I mean, they've all been basically on a it's a longer Blitz cancel to get him to come back since the postseason started. It's a long year of every single guy in there. I'm sure is has something nagging you know, and but it's three games left in the year. It's the finals you  Do whatever you gotta do to play you say right called up to try it out. Oh, I mean I don't I want to play it but he definitely did he not practice the that morning the day before like before but it does it is he wasn't clear that the day before that he wasn't cleared to go out there. So kind of weird like suddenly is the end. It does seem like it's a little weird clearly clearly. There was something wrong. Yes his like his Achilles snapped. I mean, that's the risk you take when you're trying to win a championship though. So you're not you're not losing any sleep.  I'm over Cadiz decision and pretty sure he's got insurance. Yeah, what is it? What is the consequence of a torn Achilles? You miss a year, but you are back. Okay. I thought that you kind of get some never played the same. Usually there have been guys who have come back. I know in football every sport you couldn't you can come back. Yeah and the Richard Sherman came back. You gotta he hasn't been the same guy but he's also he's older so not confirmed cornea. Either could also by other versions of that injury though. I don't really know what those are.  Yeah, I feel like you know, you can come back and be the same player, you know, even if he's not the same player he'd still he's still good enough shooter and stuff too. Right and he's so physically you guys still going to be fucking 12 feet tall? Yeah, and that's why I like you so at Tufts. Did you guys have an enforcer? There was no fighting. There's no fighting in college hockey not a lot not a lot. So you wouldn't even like you guess where I kicked out again immediately as soon as you there there have there were fights, but you would just be like I'm out of it.  This game I have to kill him our Captain's he was from South Boston. He's a nut and when I tell you he had to get stitches on his chin after every because he would just like kids up and then he gave me a Green Beret. I probably shouldn't say that. Okay. Well we'll move on for now. Okay? Yeah, I think he said a couple of things I want to ask you your opinion on something.  Add some experience. Okay, I like where this is going. But I also did more reading about it and I actually think it may be less complicated I think but I was wondering what you thought about college athletes getting paid getting paid now the background on this is I actually don't think people really know what we're talking about when we say that I until this afternoon when I broke ranks and did research ahead of the Pod thought that the  The idea would be some sort of actual salary or stipend or whatever it is. And then I realized when you were coming in that I that put me in a tough spot because obviously someone playing D3 and off sport isn't going to be getting the same as the guy who plays basketball football Michigan, right? And so then it becomes just a total fucking shit show. How do you figure out who gets what and that made me think I actually don't have a position on this then I read up and it turns out no one's talking about paying the  Players a salary they're talking about letting them it's right profit off of their name and likeness. So what that's the backdrop. Where are you at on all this? Well, the first thing is you go to you go to school all these D1 schools. You're getting you go to Michigan Michigan cost $50,000 for out-of-state kids. I mean, you're getting paid 50 G's a year. You're getting your limited food you getting living. You're not you literally don't have this you get free clothes you get free equipment you get  Get everything's freaking at 75 year. I'm more. Oh, I mean we get you know, I mean you on the road you get you know, 20 bucks a meal when someone when you're traveling you're on the road a lot. I mean you get tutors tutors cost bunny. Everything is paid for when you're at school. Everything's paid even with you. You went to Tufts. I want to drop your arms. Oh shit. No D3 doesn't have scholarships. So my dad was the school.  Yeah respect nothing against time. I'm not playing you still got my Guardians when you travel this time travel. We had to be at school during Thanksgiving. We had to be at school all winter break like we were getting money every day. They are just so happened that our coach, you know lost some of the money and from the kids actually need that money to survive and it ended up that we had a couple very wealthy kids on our team who  Ended up paying for meals for our teammates. Yeah. Yeah. I mean the guys who come in with you there. Your these are my best friends for life. Yeah, they've got I speak to them every day. I see them every weekend still 10 years later almost, you know, Terry company kind of like went through. Yeah, basically, I mean, it's just so you but bass think that I mean if you're get your players should get into your tongue and CW football video game that they sell a billion dollars.  Worth yes. Okay, so your but there should be a profit share situation going on. Okay. So the idea of being paid is out that's you're saying you're already being paid for your services and then you're into if someone is it is it you can go out and try to profit as much or is it if they're going to profit you share see that's another question. Are you allowed to just become a business? Do you support? I'm day one freshman. I'm going to turn off of this and and then that's that I'm taking it or I've only  I won't be difficult. It would be really difficult because you have the start like what's his name Zion, you know, he'd make up he'd make 25 million dollars this year. How are you? You can't that's just let that unfair for 95% of the kids. You're playing against nobody's making to make that like he's gonna pay him that Sprites gonna pay him but there are so many D1 schools like you look at you look at the tournament. There are schools all over the country that nobody knows anything about these kids and they're all getting.  In Scholarships in this and that and I mean, how could you let someone make like professional sports? Everybody has the opportunity everybody's getting paid Millions, whatever there's so many kids freshman. You don't know who he is yet. How could you let him make zero and Zion make 20 million. I think I would read it's just unfair something. I think I'm team Clubhouse for sure for sure. It's bad. I see the fabric of the team. So for sure and also,  Become service self-perpetuating cycle where the stars become bigger than the program bigger than everything program and they become such big stars that they don't even know. There's no attention paid to any other player besides it wouldn't I am literally becomes the only player in the NCAA this year because he's such a big star Eddie, right? And then all that money, then you see my commercials like they talked about them and it's just I think it would as a fairness standpoint for the rest of the kids because you have these are  Kids, you know if you're good enough to be in the NBA at 19 fine. You only have to play one year in the in college. Then you go make your Millions. I just think they need to get rid of that rule because if you're good enough to be 18, then you should be in your back. You're fully support jumping from high school. I was going to say this is this is again uniquely basketball problem. No one's going straight to the NFL from high school. He writes a 17 year old kid 19 kids.  You playing here's of Juniors were prep school. And you do a PG year and then you play Juniors most kids are going to school at 2021. They're not even starting thinking of a pro at 18 except for like a couple guys did I think that they're talking about is a cat? So it's up to five grand that the player can make or something like this. It's not even worth the rule that's not even worth it you means  Gonna be like, are you joking? I had a booster. Give me a hundred G's last week. What do I need five grand from nobody like he's gonna like he's not gonna sign me for five. I'm not gonna sign with Nike from five brand. So even if they're going to make a billion dollars off me. Yeah, totally, you know, even profit sharing your off somebody from MIT or Harvard has to figure out that number the algorithm. Like, how are you going to do that? All right. Well, he's a question exactly. Keep going.  Zion wait, she gonna play for New Orleans or she wait, you know, you go back to school. Go back to go brother. You're awesome. Awesome. City is an awesome City who they got. Nobody Davis is out. He's leaving people are going to want to go play was that and now obviously Zions not by all accounts. There's no chance these days for another he's gonna it's gonna get picked first by Nola. It's going to play into a I'm just curious if you were him. Would you work in you doing?  I marry and be like I'm just not going to sign their you should trade me. Probably. Well. I actually think that they'd be a good franchise to play for especially for young guy because their new GM Griffin the guy built the team around the brawn when they wanted 16 just started there and I think the he can build an ice core around these it whether I like hot chicks. I mean, so I would I fire him I would go Joe. You're not talking about you. Okay. Come on Zion bag.  Okay. Yeah, okay, but but this is a good a good question people complain. I've certainly I'm not that hard core of a Catholic. I think NBA basketball in general has a very much like get your money kind of mentality and that goes for the college and high school guys to the paying the players will be allowing the endorsements maybe keeps some of these guys in school, right? And then the college game which has been basically turn into like an 18-month albums.  We have your turning guys out. You got the three top guys. They're all gone already. I didn't get a chance to know them. You have to be such a h\",\n",
              "   \"Hello, I'm Brandon Perna host of that's good sports a 10-minute ish Daily NFL comedy podcast. Have you ever wished for a crappy version of The Daily Show, but only about the NFL then first and foremost. I implore you to dream much bigger. Secondly, I would recommend subscribing to that's good sports every week day. I will be giving you NFL news telling questionable jokes and swearing just enough so you won't ever be able to listen with your kids in the room.  Or car I don't ask for a lot. But if you don't subscribe on iTunes, my wife said she will leave me. Thanks and I look forward to putting my voice in your ear holes.  blue liar  It's exciting to win money.  Is there anything you don't gamble really?  Gambling God fickle Bunch. So easily offended about your problem. You're just an idiot.  And we welcome you into another edition of Full Slate of blue wire gambling podcast. My name is Greg Frankie and get me on Twitter at undercover. Greg joined as always by Showtime cappers himself at Showtime campers on Twitter Matt Siegal is how I know them. But nonetheless, we're just here to give you plenty of more pics for your football weekend. It's week 5 in college football week for in the National Football League with a normal Friday gang here on Full Slate.  And we hope we can make you guys some money this weekend that always good to chat with you how we doing Greg Greg. What's up? I'm excited for this weekend and it fell week for college week 5 like you said, unfortunately, I believe we've got two teams on a by so that's one less game for us to gamble on but nonetheless the season is getting into full effect. We have three weeks of NFL to look at four weeks of college football to check out, you know, and now we are really starting to get  It into a we are really starting to see who are the contenders who are The Pretenders we got three no teams. We got only three teams who saving their season who's getting eliminated week for gonna tell us a lot. Oh, no, I totally agree. I think this is, you know, the quarter turn of the National Football League season for everybody except the Jets in the 49ers who won't play their fourth game until next week. So it's starting to get to the point of the year when you know a little bit more you have a few more data points, which always makes it a little more interesting.  As far as a handicapping perspective, but let's Jump Right In And as always don't forget Craig Melvin Gordon, he's back for my fantasy team next week and I go yeah, we're excited and it doesn't seem like he's gonna play on Sunday against the Dolphins, but he won't he won't but he'll be back next the following week and I accept two touchdowns out of the man. He's hungry Keenan Allen posted the video there. Hope to have him back in the locker room. He's a beast so we will certainly get to the National Football League later on in the Pod. But as always we start in the  is ranks and I'm actually going to give you my Max play for college football week 5 right out of the gate. It's the Maryland Terrapins plus the six and a half. I'm also playing Maryland on the money line for one unit. Here's what I'm looking at Maryland at home in College Park against what is maybe not in Penn State's mind a rivalry, but Maryland I know is going to be very jacked up for this game the head-to-head historical series between these two schools has been very one-sided in  For Penn State. So that's why I say maybe Penn State doesn't quite Creek Maryland with the same animosity that Maryland treats Penn State with but in a way, I think that actually is an angle that I'm looking to exploit here in favor of Maryland. Both of these teams are coming off of a by and you have a Maryland team that it's really hard to Fathom how they got in the red zone. So often against Temple and time and time again could not punch it in. I wasn't upset about it Greg. I wasn't upset about it either at neither was I as I was  As I was on my house catching the points and on the money line as well. So I'll gladly take it but now I looked at this game and it was part of the reason. I like Temple against Maryland two weeks ago. I thought that there would be some look ahead with the bye week and then Penn State coming for Maryland now they get back home and they had this to do over a game that they probably should have won against Temple and it's none other but Penn State come into town on Friday Night Under The Lights nationally televised game on FS1 and let me tell you also something that  Penn State I have not been that impressed with them so far. They played a putrid first half against Buffalo in their second game of the year. Buffalo went to the locker room with a 10-7 lead before Penn State got its act together and then Penn State extremely fortunate to pull out a 17 to 10 Victory against Pittsburgh two weeks ago. Thanks to patent or Juicy's ineptitude kick in the field goal on the on the one yard line. So I just don't like Penn State is good enough to be laying a touchdown in a conference game throw in the motivational factors from  Maryland like I mentioned I'm on the turf plus the points Greg. I love where your head's at. You know personally. I didn't take the Maryland plus six and a half yet keyword yet. I will evaluate that later in the day. So everyone stay on my Twitter that can easily be an ad but as you guys know, I put it out earlier this week. I am on the Maryland plus three and a half in the first half for a lot of the same reasons. Greg likes the full game. I like Maryland to come out in the first half at home.  And get the party started early we've seen Penn State struggle to start games early against Pitt. We were all pit, you know, we saw how they really really just and that was at home Greg. I mean, you know right on the road like, you know in the second half they didn't and they didn't  But like you said Maryland use this as a rivalry Greg, I don't know how much Penn State really does. But I know Maryland does and I know Maryland's going to come out Friday Night Lights. They're going to come out they're gonna cover three and a half for sure. I wouldn't be surprised if they're leading at halftime and that might be a play. I looked at this is a very interesting game. I'm definitely going to be looking at the second half when halftime hits like I said stay on the Twitter because I might I might add the full game, but for right now I got Maryland plus three and a half.  The first half there you have it. First play is a Max for me on Maryland full game plus the six and a half. I will be taking the Maryland money line for one unit. I already have and make sure in the first half plus 3 and 1/2. Go ahead get in. What else you wanted to say about Friday night before we move on. I'm sorry. Graham didn't mean to cut you off. I just want to make sure everyone checks checks Greg and I Twitter for the rest of our place for the Friday Night Lights because we're going to move on to the big games on Saturday, but I got a few nice little one unit guys to keep you occupied.  While you're out drinking at the bar there you have it. So let's get right to it with an early consensus play for both of us in the noon Eastern slate on Saturday. And we're going to go I guess a little bit off the beaten path here with an independent team taking on a group of five team and we're going to take the group of five team in the Mac a little match in for you the Toledo Rockets at home on the money line. I got them at plus 115 and they welcome in the BYU Cougars and this is just a classic.  But down College spot that I look to play and I know be why you didnt have it's a game last week against Washington, but think about BYU four games in they open the season with an in-state rivalry game against Utah, then they go to Tennessee and SEC opponent and they pull out a dramatic overtime Victory and they whole overtime or double overtime. Thank you, then. They have a huge outright upset against USC.  Overtime again exactly and last week while they lost the game another nationally ranked opponent in the Washington Huskies. So after all of that, you're going to tell me now that BYU this is this may end up being there's obviously some TBD start times as well for BYU the rest of the season, but this is their earliest start time yet. Obviously BYU in Utah traveling to Ohio to play Toledo at 11 a.m. Central Time, I guess 10 a.m. Mountain time for them.  You have a Toledo team that been a pretty successful group of five program of late. Obviously the coach now, I don't Iowa State Matt Campbell was very successful at Toledo and moved on and Toledo has been scoring points 41 against Colorado State last week 45 against Murray State the week before that and they put up 24 on a Kentucky team that if you watch Kentucky at all last year, you know, they Pride itself on really good defense so Matt, here's what I can they put up a fight in that game. They were tied 14-14 at half.  Right. So here's what I'm seeing. I see a Toledo team that's going to get out early and that's going to score points. BYU body clocks might be a little bit of a factor as I mentioned and I think BYU's is going to be chasing this game the whole way therefore. I'm not really that worried about taking the two and a half points because I think Toledo wins out right? I'm on the Toledo moneyline Greg, you took you took the words right out of my mouth. I mean, I took the two plus two and a half for top play. I'll probably into play. I mean if you play the money line, that's fine. I don't think the punching me Factory I think Toledo at home gets  It's done. One of the bigger games on their schedule a class classic classic letdown spot for BYU after playing four teams. Although there are two and two playing for teens clearly while well above Toledo status and pulling out two of them in double overtime and losing to other two nationally ranked teams at home. You know, this is clearly a game that BYU is not going to get up for as much as Toledo at home gets up for body clocks and issue travel slight issue I got  You know, I'd home rolling easily in this game there you have it were consensus on the Toledo Rockets on the money line for the better price. Don't worry about the points. You're going to take us to Madison next as we go into the Big Ten. What do you got on the Badgers? Yeah, I mean Craig, it's a crime. I think I can't even put it on my words. I'm stuttering so much because I was so happy. I was able to get this content - 13 a half in the first half it two touchdowns. Literally. I think I'm robbing someone with that it  It's just unfair the Badgers obviously I got the better end of you Greg. I gotta brag a little bit laughs its Michigan could say you were wrong. But you kind of were wrong, you know, Wisconsin, you know, it happens. It happens to the best of us. You'll get me plenty more times. What can you say about Wisconsin Greg three, you know this year three-and-oh against the spread the past two games. They played at home. They had a bye week we know in the middle of them. So that means in this past three weeks. They haven't been traveling.  Nice comfy what I asked you last week Craig you like sleeping in your own bed, don't you? So do these guys? Let me tell you Northwestern just got a beating at home against Michigan State and let me tell you going on the road. It's a Wisconsin is just doesn't get easier for them. Right Wisconsin has just been a train. They run the ball. They control the clock. They they cover why do they cover exactly what I said because they score with these long methodical Drive.  Who's running the clock? The clock is always running in the scoring and then they get stopped before you know, it there's six minutes left in the second quarter and their up 21. Oh and you just don't know what hit you I think this is a great play another one of my plays. I've spoke about all year why I'm specifically playing Wisconsin first half minus 13 and a half for top play. They'll be up two touchdowns or more at halftime book it hard to argue with that. I mean as you kind of alluded to Wisconsin very impressive last week, and I was out  See on the wrong end of that one. I'll take it. You got me there you're going to go to another powerhouse on the First cast my way quick little note, Wisconsin 3 and ogun to spread Northwestern is not only Owen three against the spread full game Owen three against the spread first half Grand. I mean so take this little Trends out of three games what you will but that just tells me that Northwestern, you know, they don't know how to cover the spread. We're both on your guy gaalan hurts in the first half and the Oklahoma Sooners. I'll let you lead the way here.  And Oklahoma first half against Texas Tech man. Oh God. It was a it was a real crime. My man. Jalen Hurd was not in action last week, but let me tell you he's back and he is ready to ball. He had a week off at home in front of in-state rivalry, Texas Tech. What can I say about this, Oklahoma Sooners are ready to explode in this game Greg another play. I love in the first half.  - Fourteen and a half. I've been playing Oklahoma Sooners in the first half all year. I'm going to play the minus 27 for the full game for one unit. I'm playing - 14 and a half for the first half for two units coming off a bye at home in front of their crowd in-state rivalry. They're going to take it to them. They're going to be a by at least three scores in the first half and Jalen hurts. He's just going to continue his Heisman campaign. By the way, if you booked it with me preseason at plus fifteen hundred or after week one at 800 or  After we to at 600 he's now down Greg to just plus 300 in some shots. So I like where my bets going there and I'm putting my money behind Jalen hurts. Once again, one other thing. I like on this game Texas Tech was kind of sleepwalking two weeks ago against Arizona and in a non-conference game coming off of a by and now huge huge coaching mismatch here first conference game for the new head coach at Texas Tech Matt Wells and who's he have to go up against Lincoln Riley welcome.  A big wall. Welcome to the Big 12. You took the words right out of my mouth. I'm going to stay in the Big 12 actually and I'm going to go to the Bailey. I'm sorry. I apologize for move on from that game. I also did play the under 71. I think I'll go home is defense is going to come with some nice adjustments. Like you said think there's a big coaching coaching mismatch here and I think Texas Tech Will struggle to score more than we think and I think 71 is a lot of points. I like the under 71 as I said, I am going to stay in the Big 12 next and I am going to go.  Oh to the Baylor Baylor Baylor Bears, excuse me, as a short home dog against the Iowa State Cyclones. Here's what I'm seeing first off Iowa State coming off of a victory last week against albeit, Louisiana Monroe the game before that against Iowa was I think a lot more telling as to the Ohio State team we're going to see they didn't score that much against Iowa only 17 points 29 against FCS Northern Iowa to sew that right off. The bat tells me I don't  That I feel comfortable laying points with Iowa State. I also have Iowa State under eight wins. This was a game that I circled and thought this would be a tough one for Iowa State to go into hueco. Third year for my guy former Temple coach Matt Rule and let me tell you about Matt rule as an underdog Matt 14 times. He's been an underdog of seven points or less. He's won 11 of those 14 games out, right? This guy gets his team's up to play. I saw it at Temple. They were ready every time they were counted out.  Out as the dog and another interesting little thing. I like about this game Baylor very unconvincing 2113 Victory last week against rice. And so I think we're seeing a little bit of an over reaction. Now they're coming into their first conference game as the home dog. Had they blown out rice the way they blew out Stephen F Austin and UTSA and their first two games this game probably as around Pick'em, so I think that's an overreaction. I think Matt rule as I said, he's very successful as a dog. I think he kind of rides that narrative a little bit this  Weak give you the Baylor Bears plus the two and a half against Iowa State Greg. I don't hate it. I like where your head's at. And I do think it's going to be a competitive rocks late rivalry game here. That's why I actually did side with the under in this game. Let's keep it moving and we're going to go to South Bend with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. I'll let you start. I just went with Baylor. I have a play on this game as well. But Notre Dame and Virginia what he got.  Greg, you know, I'm going to sound really repetitive. It's going to quite it's gonna be kind of funny by the time we finish his college football segment. But Greg you take a guess. Where do you think I'm going with this one? Let the listeners know with confidence first half Oklahoma first half something tells me you're going Notre Dame first half Greg. You got it man. I got this at six and a half some shops have up to seven. I did pay a slight bit more juice for this. I believe I'll have to double check but I believe it was around -  135 and Greg I was happy to pay that at six and a half. It's still available some out there. If not seven is fine. I liked what I saw. I don't know if you did but I liked what I saw Notre Dame last week. They pull back biting its poor Drucker on National Television on the road, you know, obviously for Notre Dame fans Not the outcome you wanted but they put up a fight. They're going to come home. They're gonna play this this quote-unquote. I'm using air quotes Greg you can't see but quote unquote.  Ranked for no UVA team. I don't really know who they be in or if they're that good. Yes, they beat FSU. We know FSU has been struggling Old Dominion William and Mary they want at Pitt. I'm not buying this for no and number 18 ranking from the Virginia Cavaliers, and I don't think the Fighting Irish are either coming in and they just put up a big fight on the road against Georgia. They're gonna come home in South Bend in front of their home crowd. They're going to get the  Started early here and they're going to be up I think seven is fine because I would be surprised if they're up to three scores the first half they're looking to run UVA out of South Bend in a hurry. You know, this is the side I would take I my stronger play though is actually going to be on under the total as I bet this at 48 and a half. I like it under because I really liked what I saw out of Notre Dame's defense last week. There were flying around. Yeah. They were keeping them right in that game only allow 23 points.  Against the Bulldogs and so I have to think even though they lost the game. I think Notre Dame exceeded a lot of people's expectations because of what we knew about Notre Dame in these big spots in the past. So I think in a weird way while they lost the game, I think they're going to come out pretty motivated here, which is why I do like that play of yours, but I think the motivation particularly lends itself to defense flying around keeping a Virginia team that has it been like they didn't look great at all.  Against Old Dominion last week. I was on Old Dominion plotter overrated Greg brush wet winter and then you look at Virginia defensively. They've been pretty good 14 points allowed against Pittsburgh 17 against William and Mary the high-water Mark was 424. I'm sorry allow by Florida State. So when I look at this game, I think both defenses show up Notre Dame's going to win this game. I would lean to them laying the points, but I certainly like it under forty eight and a half. Yeah. I mean, I think we can agree kind of like what you alluded to Notre Dame, you know for their  Standards, obviously, we know realistically no, but they almost they won the game, you know, they they had a moral Victory losing to Georgia the way the\",\n",
              "   \"On episode 50 of the big swing podcast. We remember Kobe Bryant one of the all-time greats. We talked about what he meant to us the Legacy. He will leave a very sad time in sports and in basketball and in the city of La so we give our takes the best we can on Kobe Bryant and his legacy and what we'll remember most it seems like a lot of other sports stories or insignificant right now, but The big gain these Super Bowl is coming up this week and Ross and I are going to talk about all things 49ers vs. Chiefs preview the game break down the advantages of each team and what we think will happen.

So let us know on Instagram and Twitter if your And ongoing we would love to kind of get a head count and see who's going to be showing up. All right, let's get right into it. Remembering Kobe Bryant Super Bowl preview beast of the week. Let's go. What's going on Swingers? Welcome to episode 50 of the big swing podcast. We are halfway to a hundred and it's just about a year in and we're already at 50 episodes. So we really appreciate you guys supporting us along the way we actually started out our first episode previewing the Super Bowl last year. And now we're doing it again this year Ross. How has it been man of you enjoy it so far man 50 episodes. I don't think I don't think I would have guessed us to be as Assistant as we've been I really don't I think 50 episodes and a little over a year. We miss maybe three or four weeks. I mean, that's pretty good man. You think about your travel schedule my travel schedule we're never in the same place man. We go back to some of the guests we had early. I mean, we've had a good little crop of guess man. Not a 50 man between CJ McCollum and all the Dodger guys and some big-time athletes and people around the world man. It's been a blast so looking forward to your to and building off what we've done so far. Yeah.  It's wild to think that we've plugged in these microphones and recorded like 50 hours of material. Yeah, since we had that much to talk about but apparently we do. Yeah. Well, unfortunately we got some pretty crappy stuff to start the podcast with Kobe. Unfortunately passed away this week and a tragic death with eight other people involved in a helicopter accident. So I know you were in La during all of that and I know the city  Got to be bleeding in really upset about it. So like what was what was the vibe around the city when you were there man, I wrote all sorts of stuff down anticipating talking about this and it's in it. Just a jumbled order. I have no idea how it's going to come out the first time. I heard it. We were down in Manhattan Beach and we were with a buddy and he said man, I think Kobe Bryant just died in a helicopter crash and I was kind of like, yeah, okay, you know, it sounded like a joke TMZ reported. It kind of seemed I got on Twitter. I didn't see  Anything about it and I'm just like man, I don't know that seems made up or something and then over the next 15 20 minutes. It was just everywhere and man you could basically feel it kind of walking down the streets of Manhattan Beach. You could almost feel the air kind of gets sucked out of the little city that we were in right there in downtown and man if you talk about a guy that kind of is Los Angeles and that was Kobe Bryant so that city is going to mourn.  For a long time and as I'm sure you are massive basketball fan grew up watching Kobe. Imagine it hit you hard as well. Yeah, man, and I was sort of the same way. I had a couple people text me and same and you see what happened to Kobe and I tried to look it up and you know Kobe was one of those guys that was just sort of unbreakable and felt invincible and you know, when I remember watching him play against my team growing up it just felt like there was nothing we could do to stop this guy.  Guy like he was he was unbreakable. And when I got the news that he had passed away in such a sudden way. It just didn't feel real because I just I always felt like he was just invincible and he was going to live forever and he was just that guy and it was just really surreal and it's really sunk in the last couple days because I think about my first memories as a basketball fan and everyone that listen to this podcast knows how big of a basketball fan I am and you know,  Was drafted in 96 I was born in 92. So he's really my first memories of the sport. I don't really when I think about basketball it's starts with Kobe and and really, you know, he just retired a couple years ago and it felt like I had been a part of that Journey for my entire life. So it's really sad to think back. I don't know how many times I've had a conversation with my friends where we say. Hey who's the top 10 players and it always starts with since  Be Bryant because that's really when we can comprehend basketball so such a giant throughout my life such an influence For Me growing Up playing basketball and following the sport. So it's just a horrible tragedy. And you know, I just feel for the city of La you know me being from Houston often was rooting against Kobe, but respect to the hell out of them, but you really think about what player is more connected to a city and its really  Hard to find someone that's more just entrenched in the fabric of it. I guess maybe Brady and Boston Jeter in New York, possibly Breeze in New Orleans. But still it doesn't feel the same as Kobe in La. Yeah. I mean, you don't have to be a basketball fan or even a Los Angeles resident to for this one to hurt your heart. I mean it is it's as tragic as anything that I've seen in my lifetime, but also its kind of brought people together from around the world.  In a way that I don't know if I've ever seen and kind of many think about like where we are politically and all that kind of stuff right now how we're kind of split down the middle as a nation almost this this tragedy brought people together on social media. I mean it I always kind of thought Kobe was a guy that didn't have any friends he kind of played, you know in a way that was just so Cutthroat and such a leader in such an intense guy that maybe didn't have a lot of friends and you have all these young players like Gordon Hayward.  Bird and Trey young and just player after player and even celebrities Jimmy Fallon Ellen DeGeneres all these people coming out and saying how Kobe touched their lives and man. It's actually been very inspirational. I didn't really know that he was like that and it kind of sounds like his impact after basketball was going to be as much if not more than what he did on the court during his career and it's kind of sad to think what he had left in them and never got a chance to accomplish. Yeah, man that you hit it.  It perfectly that was the thing that surprised me the most is just the array of people from different fields reaching out and offering support to their family and their condolences for Kobe and offering a really good story and anecdote from their time with Kobe and you know, it was from everyone like you said Jimmy Fallon to current athletes to football players to everyone had a piece of Kobe at some point and you know, when you watch them it felt like he was just the most singular Focus guy.  In the world and he didn't have any other interest but playing basketball and perfecting that sport but it comes to find out you know, he loved to read love to write was a super curious guy, you know post career. He won an Oscar for a short film called dear basketball, which is just crazy to think that he was able to excel in something so quickly after and you know, he had a production company a riding company that he was really invested in and you know doing things for ESPN. So, you know, it's really cool.  That what he was able to do after and you talked about it. It seemed like he didn't have any friends when he was playing like it really felt like that like it was just him against the world. But you know, it was cool how he post-career sort of embrace some guys like I thought he was really cool to some of the young guys. He he had the mama camp where he brought in a lot of young guys this offseason and kind of taught him their ways and then, you know LeBron coming to La like he did not have to embrace that situation and I thought  Was awesome to LeBron in really accepted him with open arms in the city that he's been king of basketball for 20 years and he brings in LeBron James and says, hey man, here's the key. So I thought that was super cool as well. I think one thing that'll always impressed me about Kobe in that. I don't know if I've ever seen really since him and you think of all these Mega stars that we have and LeBron and Tom Brady and I mean you can just the list goes on and on obviously, but  Kobe to me is like that Alpha athlete of all of them. Yeah in a way that I just don't know that I've ever seen and as a professional athlete I see these guys like Kershaw and Arenado and Goldschmidt and you know Scherzer all these just a plus athletes that are unbelievable, but Kobe seem to have liked this work ethic above anyone else and then on top of that the personality that he portrayed and like how he demanded perfection.  Himself, and the people around them. I mean he raised the bar for everyone not just basketball players, but for every professional athlete he raised the bar and is someone that you looked up to and all you heard about were 5:30 a.m. Shoot arounds and then eight AM practice and then another 10 a.m. Shoot around and then he would go out there and the story I think Lou Williams told it that they got blown out by the Portland Trail Blazers in Kobe Bryant comes in and takes everyone's Kobe shoes away.  Way from them and says you guys aren't worthy to wear these based on the game that I just watched and takes their shoes away. You know, I don't I'm around leaders and clubhouses all the time, but you really not around someone that's just cut throat and romantic demands Perfection like that very often and still has the respect and love and admiration that people had from it was an unbelievable balance that you know, I don't know if we have in sports right now or that will really see again anytime soon. Yeah. I was trying to think.  To about you know, you were talking about the intensity and the presence on the court. That's Alpha mentality and I was trying to think about athletes that have gone against my teams that you just most felt like you always felt Kobe out there like you just had an anxiety as an opposing fan that he was going to rip your heart out and you were never fully winning the game you felt like you always had to do everything right playing Kobe. You just you just always felt him on the floor and there was there was  never a time where you felt like the effort was lacking or he wasn't going to rise to the moment or be ready for the moment and accept it like Kobe was the moment and that was the cool thing about him. Like he you know, he didn't have moments man. He was the moment and that was just so cool to see and at the time you hated it and you loathe Kobe, but at the same time man, you respected the shit out of them and you wish you was on your team and he beat you over and over. I mean, you're a Mavs fan growing up. I was a Rockets.  And the amount of times that Kobe ripped our hearts out was astonishing it just over and over. It happened. He was just the basketball Savant you know, like he took it seriously as a craft like he worked on his footwork the way he got two spots on the court like these angles that he used. I mean, he was an absolute scoring machine that perfected it he perfected the game of basketball and he did it with an extreme intensity that like you said is just probably unrivaled in.  Sports and we'll probably never see something like that again. Yeah, I mean the last thing I'm going to say about it is a is a sad story of he came and threw out the first pitch of the World Series game and he's in there talking to Bellinger and Kershaw and jock and all these people are kind of having quick conversations with them. And for one, you could just feel his presence when he walked in the locker room. I mean, he commanded the room without saying a word in a way that I haven't really seen and we have famous people coming in and out of that locker room all the time whether it's actors athletes, whatever they are and he commanded a room  Of basically Superior athletes more than anyone I've ever seen and not Superior athletes to him. But I mean just like high-level professional athletes. Yeah, and any who all these guys are talking to them and I'm trying to get ready for a World Series game and we're getting close to first pitch which he's throwing and I remember thinking like man, I'll get a chance to meet him. I mean I shook his hand but I you know, I'll get a chance to talk to him again. I'll get a chance it will be around and all that stuff. And this was, you know now two years ago and  Never got a chance to see him again. So just kind of one of those things you've seen around social media. You've seen people saying it man like the idea of take advantage of an opportunity that you have. Tell your loved ones that you love them. If you have something going on with a friend or a family member where you guys are fighting or whatever it is, you know, try and mend that relationship because it is one of those things that you just kind of don't know if you'll get another chance and you know this certainly brings that to light and to think that you know, I sat there thinking I'll get another chance to meet Kobe.  He and pick his brain and get to know more and Lala and never came to fruition. So, you know, that's that's sad and something that I'll kind of remember and think about forever. Yeah, well said man before we end it I just kind of wanted to go over some of his stats and accolades and 18-time All-Star 15-time all in be a 12-time all-defense two Olympic gold medals five-time NBA championship champion and only one MVP.  Surprisingly but he had a quote in 2015 in an interview when they asked how he wanted to be remembered and he said I've always said that I wanted to be remembered as a player that didn't waste a moment and didn't waste a day. Well, kobey's absolutely you did not waste a moment. You did not waste a day so our IP Mamba you will be missed and I send my condolences to the city of La. I know you're hurting and I hope it gets better. Well said, all right.  Well, let's go to a quick break to our sponsor and then we'll get back into it.

I know it's almost impossible to Fathom and event that's more important than copings passing. But there is the big game the Super Bowl coming up 49ers vs. Chief's face off in Miami and Super Bowl 50 for Kansas City is favored by minus 2 or minus 1 depending on the book and the over-under is 54 and a half. So just initial thoughts man. Are you excited for the game?  Yeah, of course. I mean it's kind of the classic Clash of like a dominating defense versus an explosive offense, you know, and everyone says I'll defense is win championships and that's probably true to an extent but there are many defenses that can contain Patrick my home. So, you know, you look at this line - to is the one I saw over under around, you know, 55 or so. It's it's tough. But to me, I would take the Chiefs. I just in a world where offense has taken over at basically every  A sport I'm going to take the best offensive player on the planet to me, which is Patrick my home. So that's where I'm leaning. What's your first thought? Yeah, it's tough. Like you said it's the tale of two tapes here. And you know first off I'm just excited that these two teams were who made it, you know, I'm kind of a front one FrontRunner when it comes to this stuff. Like I want the two best teams that I've watched to play in for me at their peaks in the regular season. These were the two best teams that I watch so it's  Be an awesome match up like the coaching matchups are interesting young Kyle Shanahan verse Andy Reid, you know, both offensive genius. Genius is Shanahan's doing it through that zone running scheme and he read through the air. So it's just two totally different teams that are dominant in their own ways that are going to clash but you know, what I'm kind of seeing from from the Chiefs is that they can run off 30 40 points whenever they want. I mean, they went on stretches where they're just Unstoppable 41  Unanswered against the Texans in the divisional round 28 unanswered against the Titans and AFC Championship. So that teams never down they can go on a run kind of like the Golden State Warriors a little bit. It's just seems like they're never out of it. So I think I would take the Chiefs but man it's going to be close. Yeah. I just, you know, you look at the 49ers and I read a little bit of just like Super Bowl previews and a lot of people think that the Niners are or have a really good chance to win and we'll  The way to pull it off because where they excel at is rushing the passer and if you're going to beat the Chiefs, obviously you have to contain Patrick Mahomes. You got to make a move his feet in the pocket and you got to get them on the ground. But my Holmes has led the Chiefs and rushing the first two playoff games. He's really good at making plays with his feet getting out of the pocket and scrambling or delivering, you know, still a 50-yard bomb while he's on the run to the right as we've seen time and time again, it's cool to see a Richard Sherman that can  You know basically lock up half of the field on one side of the other him verse Tyreke Hill or whoever they put them up against is going to be a heck of a matchup to watch but as I touched on earlier, man, I just I just don't know. I haven't really seen anyone contained Patrick Mahomes. Like you said, I mean, they can run off points at extreme rates. I think if they come out of the gates cold like they did in the first two games where they got down big and each game. I think the Niners defense has to good where they won't let him climb back.  Matter how good you are on offense. So I think the Chiefs have to come out of the game hot and if they do that, I think they'll kind of just keep it rolling keep marching down the field and keep putting up points in a way that Jimmy G and that run scheme just won't be able to keep up with yeah. It's interesting because I mean you talked about a lot of people saying San Francisco maybe better and if you look at the metrics like th\",\n",
              "   \" the line to go around with them, you know, because it's all about team, you know, yeah mesh the team together. Well my coach sees that Blows the Whistle. He's like, he's like, all right, y'all to y'all don't need to run he throws everyone else on the line because she said, you know being a leader exam like bleeding but just like stepping up here 90 exactly like not having one dude suffer by himself while everybody watches. Yeah. No, actually I have the exact opposite know that my I hated my fucking high school basketball coach like this, dude.  He hated me. I think it was because like he's a gym teacher for an elementary school. And like he wasn't the most athletic dude. I feel like he was kind of like I don't say a nerd but like he hated like The Jock type and I'm not saying that I was like a big just like I didn't see I wasn't a huge asshole in school. Like I was a starting quarterback and I played basketball. I played baseball. So he took it as me being the starting quarterback. I was like my head was too big like I think I'm as big cocky kid, which I really wasn't.  So I had a it was tryouts for basketball and we had like the football team like dinner for like the end of the season like the banquet. So I told I emailed him I was like, hey coach I need to get my hair cut for this banquet that I have after a trial say like I'm not going to miss trials but I'm gonna be like, I don't help you half an hour Lakes. That's the only time I can get my hair cut. He's like, okay. Yeah, perfect. Like know where is  So I get in there. He's like where the fuck is like alcohol teams, like getting ready stretch and warmup. He's like where the fuck have you been like tryout started 15 minutes ago. And you're fucking way and I was like I fuck I emailed you and you're like, yeah, it's all good. He's like no, he's like everybody on the line, except you and he puts me in the middle of the floor and has these dudes run tends to 10 or 15 suicides and me just have to take it stand there and he's like, this is what you get you make other players you make your other friends suffer for you being late.  I tried to hop into run. He's like no go sit on the fucking star go stand in the middle of the core. All these guys saw her and I was just like that is the exact opposite of what you want to do as a team like that separates. Like it makes you a villain almost I'm like, why are you doing this and the Very like that's a season hasn't started its tryouts and you're already acting like you're a star beef in the locker room exactly like before the team's even made its it was Unreal like  There's some coaches I love and there's some coaches that I absolutely hate it mad fucking dude. I can't I can't stand them. Yeah, that's kind of like my High School baseball coach for the varsity team. So my freshman year, you know, you basically makes all the freshmen play together and then kind of go from there. Yeah, go on in the summertime. He's like, hey, I want you to plan a summer ball team what you know this school and a couple other schools will be combined with some kids, but the money they wanted for it was super outrageous and my parents were like now we're not going to  That type of money especially when you got to buy all this stuff, you know, it's a grind and I choose and it's pretty expensive itself. So I just really don't have the time either and since then the do would not talk to me like every time like I come after the basketball season and hath like the team like for some guys that played basketball played baseball team building, you know be out there. And yeah this dude he only cared about his personal record and stuff and he would just be like, all right, you know, here's a team like doesn't matter.  What your numbers were looking like he would not like he's like, all right. These are my guys because they played Summer Ball and all this stuff LT. That's the same. Yeah, there's in my junior year. He made me play JD. I literally threw a perfect game in my JV coach has pulled me out the last inning saying, oh we need you later this week. I was only at like 50 pitches to row. I would have been like get the fuck. I was I was I was kind of mad. Am I said like, yeah, we need to save your arm. I said, I'm fine. I said, you know, I'm just gonna take my stuff and go play basketball on the court over there with these kids.  Because I was like, I'm not gonna waste my time over here like this is some BS and but yeah, I mean you've get coaches and then at the end the banquet like oh, yeah this guy place on a great summer ball team or whatever and she's like come on now like summer ball has nothing nothing to dude like high school sports bro High School sports, I think.  Our low-key like the best time for sports and also like the worst question say that it's the best time for sports because when I played I have I have the experience from both college sports and high school sports. Like I didn't realize going into college how much I'd miss high school sports. So I was like, oh, yeah, like I'm lucky I get to play like other other dudes will never play again.  Do they take the fun out of it? And it really sucks in college like high school football Friday Night Lights like it's so sick. Like it's you and the boys everybody that grew up playing ball with and I was a great time then you get to College dude, and it's like a job. They really like take it that seriously and like I only played division two, but these do we were up at like 4:00 o'clock in the morning doing running lifting, especially like meetings and stuff.  I just miss I miss like the Love of the Game because I lost it because I totally fucked me like that, but  Going back to high school like it's the best time but the coaches always somehow managed to fuck it up for the kids because it just it just pisses me off so much because it during high school. You should be able to have fun. You should be able to play multiple Sports and all these coaches like, oh no, you got to specialize in this this and this and I'm like get the fuck out here. Like I don't want my kids to be able to have to choose one sport of the other like I think it's so dominance always the coaches that are like, oh, yeah. Listen,  Like like you said, your coach is all about his personal record and she like that and that's the worst. Like I If I ever do become a coach which I kind of like want to like get into it.  I'm to do the everything for the kids like I don't care like it's fucking high school or Little League Baseball ground. There's no reason for me to care like care about what my record is like I just should be the best for the kids that are playing definitely in like for like high school basketball love my coaches, especially my cross-country coach level, you know, everything about basketball coach. Like I'm not anything special. I'm just you know, I was just hustled a lot. You know, I just knew the game inside and out kind of new.  Wow details to it. So they were like, oh, yeah, you got a great knowledge, you know, just great person. We want you to coach and over the summer time. They're like, oh we're you doing like was like well last year of school or whatever. They were going to bring down of Coach the seventh grade team this year less and which would be you know, real cool kind of dairy for I can catch. You know, I'm a twenty-year-old. Yeah kids that, you know a little bit younger than me and their parents are gonna be like kind of, you know judging a little bit but I think if you definitely need a fun  Perience and then especially like later down the road with kids and like have my own kids. I'll coach from Little League football whatever or I should say every sport because there's like soccer. I do not know just I'll be like that big support on the sidelines - but I won't be able to coach some of these Sports though. I know dude. I was actually thinking about that. So uh-huh. My family. There's only only boys like there's 13 grandsons on my dad's side of the family and I think there's a couple girls  My mom's side of the family but bro. I don't know what I'm gonna do if I have girls because I've no fucking experience with us all bro, same no idea. Yeah, it's like me I've got to it. So I don't have any sisters so definitely be different experience. But you know, I'd probably definitely spoil them especially over like my son's that I'd had my son's up a lot, you know for sports, but you know that girl though she going he's gonna get everything the fuck she wants base.  Basically, you know, she wants to she was a horse. I'll go out buy her a horse that day, you know, she wants to know what she wants this. I'll go get that. You know that men in there and then my son got hey, can I get this now? You got work your word for it. So this dress or something honey. What do you need? It's okay. I'll get it for you for sure. Talk about Curtis, bro. I'm missing Korea. Yeah, obviously a second dude. Yes. I carry mace such a great guy. It really is like  Have him having YouTube because I was really just the only people I knew was Nick my roommate and Ian my roommate who shouts the both them Ian. You're listening this in Germany, dude. What's up?  The YouTuber really like the first guys that I really got to know down here in Canberra and it's been an absolute blast to fucking past year and a half. Like I remember is actually the first time Curtis wasn't here and I was just me and you before we going out to Barbara we said here getting drunk and we had like a two-and-a-half hour conversation. Just like what our goals are going to be what we're doing after college where we want to be in our fucking careers and she like that bro. It was such a good time. That's actually when I first started thinking about doing a podcast. I was like we can really like get into  Deep shit about like just awesome. But we think I'm yeah just like it's about the future and like what we want to do with our lives and just business in general which is it was like such a chill time. Like, you know me, you know, you think of a pregame whole, you know, doing shots, you know playing Paul playing all these games getting you know, he ever messed up people breaking tables, which we do don't don't get us wrong or not always like this. But yeah, yeah, I know so like hey, you know, we breaking tables, you know, Tuesday Thursday Saturday, maybe that Friday you  no, we're getting drunk. We talking chill business, you know talk, you know, exactly but yeah, that's definitely a great conversation there really was a good time. Yeah courtesy. All right. So let's get back in the kirti kirti is just a chill dude first off, but he's down he graduated last semester was the last semester last semester. So he's down in Nashville right now made the fuck tough decision to go down to Nashville. Chill out there is  His birthday right now. So happy birthday bud. Happy birthday for it, bro. Happy birthday. Don't die. Now. Don't be spending too much money down there. So this kid going to be a neurosurgeon or hopefully if everything goes well taking the MCAT or is he looking to get into Vanderbilt? Yeah and your belts his dream school like that. He's dead Focus. He's like for the M cap. The average is 5:15. So he's going to retake the MK told me he's doing MCAT classes right now. He's going for I'm helping them up.  Up and he's like tell me it's like oh once you graduate moved to Nashville and like I was like didn't think about it. But hey now that's a possibility now exactly bro. It's all all over the place for sure. I'm the same way. Like I'm thinking Dallas with you who fucking knows like I was working for this company and every everything is online. Now, if you're a sales rep dude, you fought your boo bop and around everywhere like you don't have an office that's fucking dope. It's definitely nice just being able to travel on the go not being stuck in one spot exactly one fucking cubicle like it's always been  But yeah, do we get fucking Curtis back up here? Like I know he's having a good time down there, but we need before before we're all out of college and like we all don't want to say like go our separate ways because obviously like will be titled fucking hang out and like meet up obviously down the road and we having this yacht parties for Sheriff. Sorry, Jordan Belfort.  Yeah, fuck we had some we had some fucking crazy times. Yeah, I know obviously it's a lot farther away now from camp with living in Vanderbilt or I mean Nashville I should say but he said like I said, so when you coming up next time he's like if anything it's going to be like fake Patty's Day. Yeah, we'll see and then obviously he wants to go to spring break with us, you know Dallas Fort Worth body. It's going to be a fucking time and everybody gets down there. Yeah. It's definitely gonna be a good time.  I was always everyone goes, you know, stumbling to the beach tumbling back from the beach tumbling downtown to the bars or wherever it's at maybe even go into Miami at night or two. I don't know where I'm going to end up every night. I might be sleeping on the beach who knows what I'm saying, bro. I'm worried about that fucking past knowledge for the huh. Hey, Leslie. No the same thing that goes through you know for the beach. Do you know to make it nice and clean like? Oh, yeah. That's how it's gonna be. You know, you have a red Solo cup in your hand the skimmers, brother.  slumped out there on the beach go swimming with the sharks at night, which is  That is going to be wild like we you go down on the baseball you did. Yeah. So my first two years freshman year and sophomore year. That's right, but not last year right now. It's yeah, I stopped playing. Yeah, it's spring time last year. I was going to say because we went down with the baseball guys and like obviously you're playing baseball, but bro, like chilling the hotel's of all those guys is it's a fucking nightmare, but it's so much fun at the same time. Yeah, Whiskey Joe's, you know, so risky.  Quite a time or you know, shout out to the Pink Pony, you know anyone for the baseball team or knows about the Deep phony they definitely gonna be cracking up. Hey buddy, if you don't know about it, don't look it up don't need to know about it. That's on the real low-key. That's like that's not something you should be diving into his work. Yeah, if you buy your grandparents, you know you next to work co-worker. Don't look it up. You know, I don't look it up on your browser's I'm telling you now, bro. You got a couple pairs.  Well, we'll see I'll wait I'll let a will have one of we'll have one of our buddies on here that had a pretty good experience at ping pong is when I was down there and we'll have will tell his side of who let him tell his side of the story but I'm this place. Okay, so you guys will tell when someone's going what are you like what the pink pony? Alright so the pink pony is probably the raunchiest fucking strip club in all where is it is it's um, it's like by the New York Yankees  Use oh, yeah training facility down to Tampa. So this place how do I describe this? Um, it's pretty ghetto pretty ghetto. It's it's ratchet you go in there, you know, dude, you know, you got to pay, you know get in. Yeah, and I need to see all these like 50 year old, you know, dudes single day every strip club row has that look one section would like the fucking 50 to 70 year old dudes with the same girl every night. Just fucking paying out of their fucking ass.  And then you know, we got the whole baseball team drunk as hell is stumbling in there and these girls like oh we gonna get a lot of money from we you know, everyone goes around the stage. No once their own money no, nothing, you know, maybe a quarter or two my pop on the stage. They probably get so hard to see all these young kids walk in not realizing that we have no money and then they're like, oh where you from? Why are you down here? I'm not telling you my life story. I don't know. You don't make me call my mom to drive down here. Pick me up.  Okay, so actually I got a pretty good one. So I was like you said they have a Runway. It's pretty much like if you ever see like those fashion shows that come out of the side and they come right out. So this one chick I you will come to find out being a New Yorker a lot of people consider me as a sarcastic asshole. That isn't very nice sometimes so the only thing that the thing that I was doing bro was  I was kind of making I wouldn't touch and say that because that sounds really in bad taste towards women. Like I was I wasn't making fun of them but like this one chick came out and she was like talking a lot of trash to us. She's like, I think it was Nick through like two bucks at her and she goes on I don't even like I even want this. I only wait for the hundreds. Let's go get off the fucking stage them. I've never seen a chick with her header. I'm so glad quick problems with the gold.  Nick just slowly reaches on the stage and pulls his two dollars back. Oh my God. I was geeking my my story. You know when I went with my freshman year bunch of the guys. So, you know, they had me drive down there as the DD so I'm super sober but that go buy a dance. I'm like, all right. Okay, exactly and you know by the biggest girl out there.  And I was just like laughing, you know, and they're like so she like oh, come on back here. I said, okay, man, this girl literally destroy my pelvis like I was walking out like she broke my bones. I was like what just happened the dudes out there laughing but then I had a teammate that only played that year and then you end up quitting and he's like, yeah, like I just had sex with a stripper I said you literally just I know you just  I had sex with a stripper. I'm like, you just literally paid 400 bucks to have sex with a stripper. I said, you know how ratchet that is. And you know that girl prey has sex with these old dudes that are sitting over there then they just laughing and yeah, he felt terrible after that kid since I was making so many jokes, but it was bad when I was trying out for the team and we were talking about the spring the spring trip. I think that was the first story. Somebody told me he's like you it's like you see that kid over there.  Oh, yeah, he paid like 800 bucks 800 bucks to get his nut stuck by The Strip by strip and I was just like no fucking way. I just kept rolling like everybody was like, oh, yeah, bro, it's true. And I was like, oh my God. Yeah, it's bad. Some people don't have any limits when they go there. No kidding. Okay, so the story about our one other but it that was down there when I was down there.  He paid for they called it was a shower pretty much. So it's this huge glass box. It's pretty much it's just a shower, but it's like it puts you like out in the open like it's all glass. I was it made no sense to me why you would ever pay and then have those pretty much you getting naked and parading yourself around this girl in front of everybody in the strip club. I was like what is going I like this makes no sense.  But so he pays for it. I think he paid like fucking $200 for this. I was just what the fuck he also it was there's no alcohol at the pink pony which kind of defeats the whole purpose is because it's fully nude though. That's why they say is that what it is? Okay. I don't know why so  So this before we go back to the before I get back into the shower. This dude is sipping on the strength that this girl comes out with I was like, what are you doing? You have no idea what the fuck is in that she could be fucking poisoning you right now whatever. I was like, why are you drinking out of a strippers glass for he's like dudes alcohol. I need something. I was like it's off. That's that's fucking disgusting. That's how you wake up and you're not cargo. Thank going across.  Yeah, you're at have somewhere else. You're in a tub on ice with your kidneys fucking gone type shit. Yeah, so he pays for the \"]]}"

Go check it out download the free anchor app or go to Anchored off dot f m-- to get started. Okay, let's get back to the show.  Today's words are fatuous, silly and pointless apocryphal.  Of doubtful authenticity, although widely circulated as being true usually in regards to a story or statement a credit e having an acrid smell accurate is having an irritant Lee Strong and unpleasant taste or smell angry bitter.  Trench in see in size of - keenness and forcefulness of thought or expression or intellect euphony the quality of being pleasing to the ear, especially through a harmonious combination of words.  Trump trump Trump trump no matter what you think of him. You got to admit. He's very entertaining especially when it comes to his tweets.  A lot of his tweets are completely fascists. Remember the the whole kafei tweet where he tweeted a word that said Kofi. I like 2:00 in the morning unbelievable. Basically all of his tweets are trenchant. He's very bold once everyone to listen every once in a while though. He'll have a rather euphonious comment. I assume those pleasing tweets are in by his professional speech writers right now is impeachment trial is  Underway, some say is conversation with Ukrainian president clearly frames it but others say it that is apocryphal. We'll just have to see what happens.  That's all for GRE vocab. We wish you guys the best of luck if you're taking the test this week.  Also, if you wouldn't mind leaving us a review the be much appreciated. Thanks so much. See you next time.\n"
