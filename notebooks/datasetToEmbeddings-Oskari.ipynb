              " \"Hi everyone, and welcome to murder friends the podcast were three friends from three different countries talk about murder. My name is Alana and I'm Canadian. Hi, I'm Anna and I'm American. My name is Hannah and I'm British. So sit back and relax you're among friends. And let's talk murder. Now. Today's episode is really special because it is the conclusion of spooky month. Which in my opinion is probably the best month. You're right. I love Halloween is the best time of year. For the whole month, really? Yes spooky season. It's pretty great. I mean in general you could start wearing sweaters boots, you know, go completely black and goth and coffee. Yeah spice lattes if that's your sort of basic thing, you know, which is because it is and if you're a more murdery, no than its quad gourd season. Yeah, exactly. The only thing that I've noticed so I've been living in England for just a couple of years. And England doesn't do Halloween like North America does which is kind of a bummer, but I guess I just sort of get used to it. Where is like in Canada? It feels like everything is draped in fake cobwebs from like October 5th and on like the stores go all out all the houses go all out costumes go all out. We're here in England. Not that so much of a popular thing. Now, it's I noticed that too because I'm America as well. It's insane. Like people go nuts for Halloween. It's a big thing. I mean nobody costume people decorate their whole house. I mean some go even more nuts than Christmas with the whole house decorating. I mean, it's a massive massive thing and every house participates like here you might get obviously I have a little one so I have been trick-or-treating here with her and you might get like two houses on the street. It's just it's pretty pathetic but  But it's only because you guys don't do it. Yeah, I was never really like a thing when I was a kid. I mean it really bad Halloween, but we never went trick-or-treating we didn't do like costumes that much there were like the occasional Halloween party. But like that was a yeah, but I think that's mainly because we don't a bigger event in the UK is probably Guy Fawkes Night. Yeah, and it's so full of November. Yes, I bonfire night which is I think more of our like traditionally  British thing today. Yes, you do firework doesn't everything you don't think we set things on fire. So we do that more in Fourth of July. Yeah. I just remember like growing up in Canada Halloween you get your costume ready? Like two months in advance. So shout out to know you're like you're literally talking about it. Aren't you like for with your friends? Oh, yeah who can come up with the best costume? Yes, and then you all go to Value Village. Shout out to Value Village anybody who lived loves Value Village they are  Like a charity shop, but they go full out on Halloween because everybody goes there to buy their costume. So like you by bits and pieces and whatever so you go to Value Village. I remember one year. I must have been I want to say like nine and I was a mad scientist for Halloween true story. I'll have to dig up a picture and my mom was so good at costumes. We got this white lab coat and then ping pong balls. We like glued all over and Drew like little eyeballs on them.  And then I got like a one of the you know, like the dollar store has like a packet of plastic bugs so glued plastic bags all over I had a giant like plastic rat that we like so to my shoulder and then my mom in her absolute Grace and wisdom because it is a Halloween in Canada and it's fucking cold. She built this hat. Basically that was pink sort of like Shivani material that she  She sewed and wrapped up and put it onto a hat. So it looked like an exposed. Brain. Oh my God. Yeah, I'm not kidding and buy things like oh, so it's like a it looks really fucking cool. You're a mad scientist with an exposed brain and be your warm as hell because it's an actual hat and it's Halloween in Canada. So it might be snowing. I just like that is Halloween next to buying and a Ouija board from Zellers and then like doing the basement and like getting everybody.  Is that to me is like the perfect Halloween?  That's so funny that you mentioned about because you do have to factor in that you have to be warm because it's cold. So where I grew up in the DC area and it was cold. So you have to fact that you have your costume, but you have to work in how to get a jacket or like yeah thermals underneath it. So yeah take that into account. A lot of times you'd like by if you were buying costume at least you have to buy like a size too big so you can get your coat on underneath but then complain because it's like well, I want to be like a sexy  Cheerleader but I Gotta Wear My snowsuit on underneath this costume exactly exactly, but it was always I think more now they may call you get like the cheap Chinese with not Chinese, but I guess they made in China. They're made somewhere in a factory where they Mass produce like, you know, just the cheap costumes that you can buy where I love the the generic names on those. Oh, yeah, you're it's like wizard boy and this one. Yeah, exactly clearly a Harry Potter costume or something and do not stand close to an open flame because that now  they're definitely not claiming tried. I think they had to like legally start making them like whether like, you know, you're not just gonna immediately burst into flames like a child like you go near a feat only composed. Yeah, baby. I know back when I was younger to we made a lot of costumes that's like a big deal was to make them more so and that brings me to one of the things one of my costumes and I was desperately trying to find a picture right before we started and I'm gonna find it post it on the socials but one year.  Cited and this is the most non-scary geekiest thing ever, but I don't know why I've insisted I wanted to go as an artist. So I just wore this outfit where I made myself one of those  What are they called? Like I had a beret I have like this whole outfit with oh, do you have got a little bored? I'm bored. What are those things the palette palette and a paintbrush a carrier out and that and I just walk because I was like, I don't know but it was just and in that picture I have on white sweatpants and sweat shirt underneath the stuff because you know how you're trying again. You're trying to make yourself as warm as possible. So you have to like layer up. What kind of age are we talking here? Oh, I was like ten I mean and then nobody knew what I was.  Okay, let me know. What kid goes as an artist for Halloween. Like what a loser. I think between that and wanting to be an M&M one year, but that was like yeah, do you mean the kind of Eminem? I was a green one to be exact. Okay, but it was like I think you can probably buy the generic costumes now, but like what we live full on made it with like felt felt was your best friend Allie?  Queen oh, yeah, I remember one year. I it was a Value Village costume. We when I was a cheerleader like the most unsexy looking cheerleader, but I wanted to be a dead cheerleader because I thought I would be okay cool. So I bought a bunch of fake blood and you can get those it's almost I don't know what the material is but you put it on your face and spread it out and it looks like skin. It's disgusting and I need to cover my face in. Yeah, just not nice.  That was like a homemade Value Village. Let's not do a cheerleader. Let's do a dead cheerleader and it was disgusting like 13, right? That's cool. Yeah, but I just knowing you you're so not a chick like you're just like the opposite of like cheerleader, but then you say dead cheerleader and okay, that's definitely more you but then I think obviously Hannah you didn't do the trick or treating stuff. But I feel like you make it up. You've been making it up and your later adult life, but just by being a golf. Yeah exactly.  Really? You're like Halloween every day. You're not wrong. So, thanks.  So for this episode we were talking about what we wanted to do for spooky month and I think it was like this time last year maybe when we went camping maybe like late September. So the three of us went camping in Rye here in England and it was I don't know it was dark out. We all set out by our little homemade fire and we told murder mystery stories. So each of us told the story. It was super creepy. I'm sure everybody who was  Also camping was equally terrified because I'm pretty sure like our voices carry through that whole Campground, but I kind of wanted to do something similar where we gather around our virtual fire outside its spooky month and we're each going to tell a spooky murder mystery.  Normally here at murder friends. We tend to have fairly light episodes. Nothing to To Grim. I'd like to think a little bit a little bit lighter, but this is a different episode. So if you're not interested in really creepy fairly gruesome crimes, please go ahead and listen to one of our other episodes. This is just a special one-time thing. All of our episodes will not be this Grim. I promise.  I did some research on creepy stories. There's a couple that come to mind but none of them were really fitting and I found this one that I sort of did a little bit of a deep dive on and I yeah, you'll see why I chose it. So to set the scene imagine you're living at your family farm. It's beautiful Farm out in the in the woods your beloved maid quits because she keeps  Hearing strange noises in the house. That sucks not the end of the world but a bit creepy then you start finding newspapers in the house that no one in the family bought their actually from a city that's quite far away which nobody's travel to the house keys. Keep going missing. You see fresh footprints in the snow coming from the Dark Forest towards your farm leading to a broken door in the Farms machine room, but there are no tracks away from the  House, so the house on fire pretty much this guy. So this is the beginning of the infamous and I'm so sorry to all to German listeners hit hit enter. Now, I'm going to post it. I can't say I'm so sorry, but it is the story of the murders that happen at this Farmstead in 1922. So we got we're going back in time to a spooky.  Mystery out in Germany. So this is just a tiny small farm set about 70 kilometres north of Munich. It's one of the most gruesome and puzzling unsolved crimes in German history and it gave me nightmares. So on the evening of March thirty first nineteen twenty to six inhabitants of the farm were killed with a mattock which is like a pickaxe basically so the six victims  were the parents and dries and Seville again, so sorry for the names their Widow Widow daughter Victoria who was in her 30s and then Victoria's children who were seven and two and their new maid Maria. So like I mentioned some weird stuff started to happen before the attack so finding newspapers finding tracks to the house, but not out of the house the original  You'd quit. They was creepy noises in the night the family heard Footsteps in the Attic, but the father found nobody when he was searching the building. So overall 100% nightmare fuel creepy time. You do wonder which I'm sure I'll get to how do you kill six different people there? It's noisy or they going to be somebody's gonna wake up and then rot. I mean, it's just it seems insane. It's so it's so creepy. Anyway, okay, so  the father actually told several people about these observations, but he basically refused to accept help the details went unreported to the police. He was basically like I'm going to deal with it. It's not a big deal. No worries the family also reported seeing a man with a mustache. That's the only description we have a man with a mustache standing at the forage forests Edge and just staring at the house basically like watching them. Oh fuck creepy.  Also, I mean, it's a free country. I guess you can look wherever you want to look. So on the afternoon of the 31st the new maid Maria arrived. So Maria's sister a squirter her there and then left the farm shortly afterwards the sisters likely the last person to see everyone alive. So she literally drops off her sister at her new job. And then that's it. Basically the police believe that in the evening the sort of eldest daughter.  Victoria her seven-year-old daughter and the parents were lured to the barn where they were murdered one at a time. But I mean we're talking about the 1920s evidence collecting is not quite the same anymore. So really in this stage of the crime people don't know what happened. They believe that the perpetrator or perpetrators. They do not know how many people they use the pickaxe of belonging to the family.  Arm and killed the family with their own weapon. Basically, then the perpetrators moved into the house where they killed the maid in her bed with the same weapon and then presumably killed the two-year-old real sorry while he slept in his crib. So the family was lured to the barn the family was killed. The person went in the house got the maid and the remaining child. That's the basic premise. But even at this point people don't know.  So as you can imagine with the farm sort of out in the boonies, it took four days for people to discover that the family had actually died. They even had a machinist come out to the farm to work like to repair one of machines and he basically went worked and then left but he said he didn't he didn't even know. No, he said he didn't see any of the family and he heard nothing but sounds of the farm animals and the dog inside the bar.  So he's sort of waited around for a bit didn't see anybody thought. Well, I'm just going to do what I need to do left five hours later when he finished when he was in town. He talked about how it was super Erie and like the ghostly emptiness of the farm and how he didn't see anybody and basically that afternoon a party went back to the farm was like something's wrong. There's a lot of people at this farm and to not see anybody is not right. And so when they go back at this point four days later,  the bodies were found. It seems like it's so methodical because they would have had to know how many people were there to be able to like lure them out and like know what you're dealing because if you're it's not like you have this an automatic weapon where you're like you could you cannot to get to Graham about it. But like, you know, that's a lot of people try to contain. Yeah absolutely makes sense. And so it's almost even so Eerie. Oh, so they were worried about say they were all in the same place to threaten them into staying at the  Of those. Yeah word that makes sense to like lure them out. Look at like one after the other somehow or there I would have had to at least be like multiple people doing it. Yeah it I mean the crime itself is is super duper creepy and which is why I picked it. But also what's so frustrating is that the investigation was not really handled properly. Obviously, it's 1922. There's lots of things that they just didn't have or maybe hadn't even seen a crime like this before but basically  Basically, the crime was investigated by the Munich police and they originally were hampered by the number of people that interacted with the crime scene that bodies were moved that items removed even people cooked and ate in the Farms kitchen like while they were they're investigating. They're like, well, we're we're here who needs lunch kind of thing. Like they yeah the day after the discovery of the bodies the court physician performed the autopsies.  It was established that the madacorp like it's that basically an ice pick was most likely the murder weapon. The weapon itself was not at the scene. Then it goes on. I mean if some pretty Grim details, they're all pretty awful. I guess one of the things that makes this case a bit notorious. Oh is that the you can do it? I really do. All right. Here we go. Why do I always pick the most gruesome things to talk about? I'm so sorry, okay.  Okay, so the heads of the victims were removed and sent to Munich so they could be examined because the trauma all happen to the heads they thought well, why don't we just take all the heads and we'll go look at them in our lab. I'm not I am saying I know who's the head for evidence purposes and that's just Bonkers. Yeah all of them too. So they were kept in the Justice building and  We're later lost possibly destroyed in the Allied bombings of World War Two a couple days later after like all this happening. So we're just we're still in April the victims were buried in a cemetery. Obviously Sands heads. So imagine being like the UPS guy like who has to pick them up and take them and like you don't know or like, you know, yeah, I mean you go to the Post Office and that they asked you like what's inside is that yeah, it's me.  Like it's always just a book or always just a present for someone and you'll be like, oh this six human heads. Yeah, she's a success. And the first these has said they definitely had a bad review whoever like a prince put them someone's getting fired. I mean, uh, the police believe that the motive would be robbery but a large amount of money was actually found inside the house. So somebody did this for a very specific reason they realized that the  Trader or most likely perpetrators because obviously so many people died. I think it would be difficult if it was just one person, but they believe that the perpetrators stayed at the farm for several days after the killings because someone fed the cows had eaten an entire supply of bread from the kitchen took meat from the pantry. It's also possible. They were still there after the discovery of the bodies as neighbors reported smoke coming from the  the chimney after the fact did they not just check the house to be sure when they you know found the bodies. I mean, well, we'll get to that it's it gets creepier with no motive the police questioned more than a hundred suspects before closing the case in the 50s unsolved because it's such a notorious case and it's so gruesome and creepy there's still interest in it. But obviously at this point pretty much anybody associated with the Case is dead. There's no one left to talk.  So there there's a couple inconsistencies that mess up the investigation the original reporting belief that each family member went to the barn to the due to the restlessness sound of the animals. So it's almost like the animals were upset about something and then one by one they would go out to check on the animals, but then they found out that not even screams from the barn could be heard in the house. So why did for family members?  Boys go to the barn in the first place. They also the exact sequence of events. They couldn't be clarified without a doubt. They don't know really who died in what order or anything like that. There's only five pictures taken from the crime scene to with the bodies in the barn one of the maid in her bedroom. One of these small child's rekt crib and an outside view from the yard, no fingerprints were.  Secured the Assumption has always been that the killer was already on the premise and inside the roof before the ACT. Is it the roof? No, no. No because there were reports that they could hear footsteps and stuff. They believe that the Footsteps in the snow was them coming into the house and then the Footsteps in the Attic was them kind of moving around some of the evidence for this Theory includes that they were roof tiles that were shifted and there were like,  Hallowed bits out in hey, but then apparently and I don't know how substantiated is there might have been some activities by the father and daughter up in the roof that might be unrelated to the crime. So if that's the case, it makes sense why the father was like, oh nobody's up there because I move that stuff around or whatever on the night of the crime. So three days before the three or four days before the bodies were  Discovered this guy Michael actually passes the farm and he observed that the oven had been heated by somebody that person approached him with a lantern and kind of like freaked him out. So Michael like ran off basically. Nobody knows who that person was was it the killer was some was Michael like confused. We don't know but there's definitely a case that the person who did the crime or persons were already in the house and very likely they stayed in the house for a while afterwards, which is so  Fucking creepy. I just can't less than a year after the murders and the murder investigation. The farm was destroyed like completely demolished which actually revealed additional evidence including that ice pick that was hidden in the Attic since then the site has no structure other than a memorial Shrine. There's been no formal arrests or convictions or any sort of closure and that  That is the creepy and unsolved murder that I can't pronounce. I called terrifying than having someone in your Loft. Yeah, that's one of those light colors than waited and then killed you. Yeah, it's just like how they it was like they're obviously scoped it out. They had been there, you know ahead of time. It was all very planned and it didn't seem like did you say that they found money in the property?  Yeah, so originally they thought it was a robbery but then there was quite a lot of money that was not necessarily hidden that well in the farm like in the home and stuff so that like it's one thing is to kill somebody for money people do that all the time but to kill a whole family including a very small child and a maid like what what benefit do you have of that? Like why? Yeah creepy one more tip was that  Yeah, it's what I mean. It's like well unless I just wanted some food and drink and shelter. But I mean it seems extreme there was a couple suspects I won't go into them because as you can imagine there were tons. They were basically grasping at straws. One of them that I thought was kind of creepy was so there's the grown daughter who had the two children Victoria and her husband had reportedly been killed in the first world war. However his  She had never been recovered. So after the murders people get to speculate whether he actually did die or if he had sort of faked his death and then come back to the family because like I mentioned there was some talk that the Father Joseph and his daughter might have had the small child together the two-year-old boy. So the idea that this  actually dead husband came back and like to seek revenge and killed the family and whatever but there's like there's no evidence and it's basically that I'm just like pulling at straws. That's wild. That's a good that is very creepy story. I want to say it's called the hinter caffeic murder, but we'll post details and stuff like on the blog and whatever and you guys can check it out, but I generally thought normally I don't like unsolved crimes because it drives me nuts, but there's something  Out something about this one the fact that they were in the house like just spooky spooky creepy time.  The one I picked for today is actually also technically unsolved. However, it's pretty likely they know the suspect actually has pretty spot on it and it was that suspect who did it, but it's kind of along the same lines of like the and I'm the same I hate and solve crimes because like I don't like to like Listen to Bottom because then I'm like, oh great. Well, I've just listen to this seven part podcast and we have no conclusion. All right, so I'm not going to tell you guys what the my murders are called. Well what?  There because you've probably heard of it. I don't know if you know anything about them or I have listened anything on them, but it is it's pretty well known, but I'm going to tell you the story and then I'll tell you what it sort of is what it's called. So there's many reasons this frightens me and I will explain those sort of after or you'll get the hint of it. Anyway on the 23rd of June 1965 Houston Police attended a house to do a welfare. Check Marvin Martin had earlier placed a call to police to  Check up on his aunt and uncle Fred and Edwina Rogers as he had not been able to reach them for several days two police officers knocked on the door and eventually kicked it in as they could not gain a response a walkthrough of the house eventually LED them to the kitchen. Well, one of the patrolmen was compelled to open the refrigerator after noticing food out on the counter inside. He saw what he believed were stacks of hogs meet until they opened the crispr only to find the heads of the two homes residents Fred and Edwina.  It was of course. Sorry it was of course not Hogs mate and instead the limbs and torso of the residents in their own fridge and their own fridge. Yes. So obviously that is incredibly horrifying and it gets worse. I feel quite safe knowing that I've got quite a small fridge. Yeah saying, but I think if someone came in and killed me and James they would face in the fridge now no and I don't scrimp. But yeah, I know I mean, you know silver.  Earning and all that a subsequent autopsy and investigation LED them to believe the following occurred and I've actually tried to like take this down three days prior to the discovery of the bodies Fred Rogers was attacked and killed by blows to the head with a claw hammer. His eyes have been gouged out. You said you were turning it down that is toned down. Oh my God, Edwina Rogers had been beaten and shot execution-style in the head. The bodies were then dismembered in the upstairs bathroom by someone with at least some knowledge.  Of anatomy, there are organs had been found in nearby sewer as I'd been flushed down the toilet again. This is tone down the house have been thoroughly cleaned and the only blood led to a bedroom where they discovered a bloody Keyhole saw the bedroom belong to their son Charles Rogers and he was nowhere to be found. So Rogers was described as a reclusive and reportedly and reportedly communicated with his parents by way of notes that he slipped under the door.  Our neighbors were even unaware that Rogers lived with his parents as he generally less a home Before Dawn and did not return until after dark. So at that point, I mean, he just disappeared like he was nowhere to be found in the house and actually to this day he was never found he declared he was declared dead in 1975 or dad and absentee. A' I don't even it's like I guess he'd been gone for long enough that it's that when you your pronounced it in absence of a good day. Yeah, I think yeah.  Lord leaking. Yeah, yes, exactly. But that was they did that because they wanted to they needed to settle his estate. So so he remained the only suspect in the murders, but they're actually still considered unsolved. So let's talk about Charles Charles Frederick Rogers was born in 1921 to Fred Medina Roger attend Rogers attented a tentative can't speak attended the University of Houston where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in nuclear.  Physics during World War II he was a pilot in the United States Navy and also served in the Office of Naval intelligence after the war. He worked as a seismologist seismologist seismologist. Yes, but squeaks. Yes. Yes. I had to look it up because I couldn't you are correct. Couldn't remember what that was for Shale oil for nine years. He abruptly quit his job and 1957 without giving any explanation and that sort of went he went and I started staying with us.  Aaron's but he actually he was actually he's really smart. He's a very smart intelligent guy. He actually was really successful in her career his career and then obviously he just quit and then was living with his parents the police never really got anywhere with the investigation but reefs in recent years to forensics epa's from Houston started to investigate the case because obviously it was officially never saw of mainly they're pretty sure it was him that did it but he had obviously just  He's fled and they could never find him. So they really wanted to get to the bottom of what actually happened to where if they could track where Rogers went. So they begin tracing the money and trying to piece together what happened? So they did after some investigation. They realized that Charles childhood was really Grim with fried and Weena, they're full of alcohol emotional physical abuse from his parents, which subsequently Charles was a loner but he was like I said before extremely intelligent they found out that Charles actually owned his parents.  And then his parents had been ripping him off by taking out loans against the house and then keeping the money for himself themselves. So what the to CPAs did were they followed the money they were able to place with start to track forensically track the money like where he was able like where he went and during their investigation. They realize that Charles had escaped to Mexico and then to South America with the help of several friends and they think that he had friends that helped them because people made a lot of money for him because what he did is he  ERM he knew where all the oil was and he could had a lot of business connections and then they believed that his friend did actually help them and then obviously never said anything. They also believe Rogers was eventually killed though later on in Honduras over a coal-mining dispute. If he was alive today, he would be nearly a hundred. So of course, he wouldn't be alive anyway like at the state and so that is basically what we'll call the icebox murders. Oh see I've heard of that name, but I  I did not know any of that story. Yeah, I've heard the name to and I didn't really and I think the reason it really freaks me out is because imagine this like because I think when you start to read it or start to read about it, you just think this weirdo loner man living in his parents house and then he one day just like snaps and then kills his parents, but that is so and of course I left some of the details about what actually he did to the bodies, but that is like he didn't just kill them. He like mutilated their bodies he cut them up for sure.  Organs down the toilet chopped them up put them in the freezer because that is hatred, you know full-on planned out. Yeah, that would mean that there will some kind of motive. Yeah exactly. Like he obviously wasn't just human he snapped it was like something. Yeah. He didn't just say he's probably in their planning it and especially if it sounds like the parents were pretty toxic anyway, and maybe he just had enough I've had enough now, I'm going to get out of here and I think that's why it freaks me out that there's somebody that you could imagine somebody live with doing that and then think I'm  Part of it is so he was never found. So he managed to just escape and it's like something out of a movie where because they he just escaped to South America and then was like never seen again. That's crazy. Especially the fact that he was really successful. It wasn't that he lived at home and and never talk to anybody or never worked a day in his life or anything like very successful very intelligent and obviously very intelligent.  If he was able to escape and to not be found because I can't imagine how difficult that would be. Although I guess I mean in the in the 60s and 70s, it's a bit different but even still yeah exactly. I mean, I think it's probably easier to disappear back then obviously now, it's really probably a lot harder but it's still it's just I just found it really creepy just the idea of just the idea of him just being in that room and like slipping notes under the door didn't want to have anything to do with parents anyway, and the fact that the neighbors didn't even know that he was living there.  It was on. Can you imagine being those investigators though? Like that would traumatize you for the rest of your life? Yeah, you just open it open the door to the fridge and you see the heads in the crisper. Oh my God. No, but at least a year neither had 12. I'm like a long story. I know these feathers so they're sitting in a warehouse somewhere in Germany FedEx. Sorry, it's not funny. It's not funny.  Or I did a story and then I changed it because it wasn't right. So have you heard of the smiley face murders I've heard of oh, yes, but not not in depth. Yeah. Okay. So I'm gonna start off with a humble brag. So as you both know, I recently graduated with a criminology degree and for a social science degree. There was like a huge amount of Statistics with inner and something that a couple of people in my module groups really struggled with the understanding that just  Is two things are happening at the same time doesn't necessarily mean that they're connected or that they correlate in any way. So for example whilst like rainfall and wind shield wiper use would correlate finding a dead body in a river and there being a smiley face graffiti on the wall might not necessarily be connected, but for Kevin Gannon and Antony do art. I'm sorry, if I thought that who are retired and former NYPD detectives and legal.  Robertson who is a criminal justice Professor. There is a correlation between finding missing young white college-educated men in rivers and finding graffiti at the crime scene. Wow, when I like classic calling card. Yes. So when I first heard the story I was like bullshit but one of my late night deep dives into the internet Ganondorf and Gilbertson could have looked like quite compelling Theory and it verges on being a conspiracy theory which as you know, I enjoy  So they believe since 2008 some 40 cases have been mislabeled as accidental or undetermined drownings, but they're actually murders. Jeez. So since then their database of potential victims victims and suspicious drownings has risen to 355. They've added in additional physical evidence. And the first thing they say is D competently decomposition of these these bodies so they believe that some victims were missing for like a really long period of time  And some of them up to 40 days a year when their bodies are found the decomposition of them has only been like a few days like three days or two and a half days Gannon who I can't say the name Gannon without thinking of a video game Boss in Legend of Zelda life. So he's not Gannon or Gammon like the diamond Gannon. Okay. Yeah. So Gannon highlights lividity patterns, which is like how blood settles in a dead body lack of  Ting and the presence of insects which normally found on land which will indicate that these victims actually died on land or in the water the detectives the other two detectives do I think Gannon they highlight that there's often presence of GHB drug like the date rape drug in their systems in 99.9% of the victims. Yeah, interestingly. GHB is not often included in post-mortem toxicology tests really know so it's often.  Family of the victims for them to request that this test be undertaken or by the coroner or samples have been requested to be sent to this Trio for them to test for their research. So the outcome of this is basically they believe that these men are abducted murdered and then placed in the water. They want these deaths to be reclassified as homicides. And then their second priority is that they want to show that there is a link between them. So between all these murders for them and that link is  Is that there is often one of 13 symbols including a smiley face graffiti near the crime scene. So there's actually other symbols as well. Yeah, there's obviously been a huge rebuttals to this the FBI know they had quote not developed any evidence to support links between these tragic deaths or any evidence substantiating the theory that these deaths are the work of a serial killers and the vast majority of these instances appeared to be alcohol-related drowning and we live in like Southeast England in Kent and suddenly we see every now and then especially in the  Like young intoxicating than falling in a cold River and passing away the World Health Organization State their men are statistically more likely to die or be hospitalized from drowning and further that men are more likely to engage in Risky behaviors where the consuming alcohol or not. So like being like a dare of jumping in a river or, you know, having a little regard for their safety well on a lighter note, I mean just  Go on YouTube and you can see all the stupid videos of like men like yeah doing crazy stunts like jumping off a house into it. Whatever and you're right. Yeah, so there's actually been little physical evidence on the body is that the cases are anything but accidental drownings, so there's no blunt force trauma. There's no strangulation and there's no signs of torture and further that is called homicidal drowning. So when you physically drowns on one bike you want to kill them. It's very very rare. So dumping a body in  Doesn't wash away evidence. This is commonly believed dumping a body in cold water can actually preserve evidence such as wound patterns and it's pretty easy now to lift latent fingerprints from victim skins. So I know we talked about it in mind Hunter when we did our mind Hunter of you there. We talked about Wayne Williams who was convicted of the always believed to be responsible for the Atlanta child murders. So he's conviction was ultimately secured by Blood and fiber evidence.  Once obtained from bodies he jumped he dumped in a river. So that shows you like this cause you're dumping a body in River doesn't mean that all the evidence can be washed away and you know, you won't get caught and it just is not true. It doesn't happen. This smiley face graffiti being present is also being questioned. There's numerous photos of the faces spray-painted there are available and they're all different in style and start like size and the time frames different as well. Someone painted like a really long time ago. So I painted after the murders.  You think about it like graffiti spree like omnipresent everywhere? Yeah, and what's a common thing that you would graffiti on a wall like this something easy or a dick? Yeah. So that's a penis. We are just like giant pain. So the sensor for homicide research know in their 2010 research paper that this cheery graffiti is a cynical slap at the police by the vandals. So it's like quite a common a common thing for me. Yeah, so  So what do you think are these young white college-educated men falling and drowning rivers or is there something more Sinister? That's really tough? Because it does have the G8 all of them a lot of them having the GHB in their system. That's like a yeah. I mean I know that it can is also used as a recreational drug as well. Yeah, people take it. Yeah people just take yeah and also say if you re looking like little something and you're like gonna take a pill of someone you don't know what's in it. Yeah. Did you let him is in liquid form as  It so they'll build it and it's easy for somebody to put in a drink. I mean, I know that like near where we live like you mentioned you'll get especially around Christmas time. I think because people are out drinking in the waters really cold and we've had some of the drownings and fortunately in similar circumstance, but I do think it's just it's really okay. Maybe the smiley faces are stretched far too far, like maybe that's not you know, like you said two things can be happening, but they're not necessarily related but  But it does sound it just seems like a really high number of a very similar deaths unless that is just a truly common thing is it I don't yeah, I mean a lot of their figures come from the US and I'm saying the u.s. Is massive. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of people. Oh, yeah, what kind of like confuses me is that if there is no physical trauma to the body, so they're not if you say you had all these bodies washing up that look like they had been strangled. Okay, definitely something's going on there.  The fact that the body has like has nothing nothing except drowning like that seems hard to getting some of them do have some of them did have like injury to them. But I'm sure that could be believed to be that you know, so they hit their head and then stumbled into the river or you know, it's not yes, I think so. I personally believe it's a bit of a conspiracy theory. I think it sounds like a good you know, one of those good serial killer  the movies. Yeah, you kind of like I think it's really human to make sense of like a tragedy by believing that there is a conspiracy theory. Yeah. Thank you live with like if you live with uncertainty and like doubts pretty hard to like process. It's always easier to hold on to something else. Like it being a bigger. I think in grief that may be that there's a bigger picture or there's a bigger, you know that it's not the person the victims fault, you know, by being careless or it's just not a horrible thing that happened.  Is much easier I think to find blame and something else because there's a criminologist Scott Bond and he kind of notes that we seek to control what we fear and by believing in a conspiracy theory, it's kind of like protects you from the world around you it reduces everything to like us versus done and it lets you like pointer finger. It lets you blame someone you blame something and that's how people do a tragedy so I found that reading  Arresting hope you did too. I got my precious head. Yeah, there's a really good article on Rolling Stone were a lot more information came from about this and they actually Lincoln quite a lot of the like research papers that have been done by like the center for homicide research, which I read on it. So it's a really really good article and put links on the website. That's all I need I think as well if something starts to grow in terms of like a myth or a story or it gets publicity.  Are you hearing about like there's these smiley faces? Like I'm sure there's going to be people that will go out there and do them as like a copycat. They're not killing anybody or anything, but they're putting up these creepy smiley faces to be part of that sort of yeah story. Yeah. I definitely think you'll find that or it could just be as simple as what you said before. It's just something that when you know, when you're like doodling on like a little sheet of paper like you're on the phone you're like waiting on hold and something whatever.  Ever it's just a common thing you we travel even you know what? I mean? I don't know. It's just kind of one of those things like so who it could just be just trying too hard to connect these dots that aren't really you know there.  Alright guys, I guess that is kind of wraps it up for us. Do you know what listeners if you have a really good picture of a ridiculous costume you went as as a kid or you know, what as an adult will have it?

I write for the shepherd Express that be packing company even after boxes big change this week and with me as always. Hey Merry Christmas everybody. It's Jay. Alright club's training sports reporter from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. We have to talk about Vox because I didn't realize that ACME Packing Company was impacted. I don't pay attention. I don't pay nearly enough attention. First we have to do that noose number three here. Yeah. My name is Matty. You can call me my tub in new and improved Clarity due to a change in our recording situation. We hope it's new and we go by yeah, we'll know when we play this back it looks you waited greatly just in the last five minutes, so we'll see how things go. That's true. But yeah, I am meme Smith for acne packing company and just general Twitter Twitter rabble-rouser.  That you are sometimes you rabble-rousing that you choose the wrong safety when you are congratulating the map to the game. Yay. Okay, so let's talk about that. So huge Twitter week from atop both both ends of the spectrum because first of all his body is his GIF about his gift featuring Matt LaFleur after his after his mishap in the preseason that it pays off the hey, you know, we're going to the playoffs very prescient but afterwards when Darnell Savage complain about the cold he was like, we're so glad you're not a Bears fan, you know with the Bears any  Or so let's talk about I my wife had friends over for brunch and when you're a millennial brunch is just an excuse to drink and eat eggs also in and out of millennial. That's I mean, yeah, that's a universal that resists every Universe there. It bonds this brings us all together. Absolutely. Also my wife's co-worker Ashley brought over this monkey bread monkey bread is great. But she used Hawaiian rolls as the base of the monkey bread which added an extra little sweetness. It was it was amazing.  So I drank a lot before the game. So I gained a lot more of the story. So when you are twittering post-victory also, it's tradition. If you follow me on Twitter, you know, I always have a victory bourbon smash a mous and Savage whatever look very similar when you're drunk. Okay, uh-huh, and I responded to Darnell sad.  As if he was Adrian tables. Oh dear, you know I've been drunk before Paul II think when I'm drunk, I don't confuse Darnell Savage for Adrian a most. Yeah. I have not personally had that problem also not personally had that problem. I haven't been drinking Bourbon and forever though. So in fact, probably not since before the Packers acquired Adrian am oh, so I guess I can't speak to that specifically their ATS are similar enough to where if you've had a couple two three, you might confuse them. Uh-huh fair enough. Okay fair enough. Anyway, great week from a tub on the Twitter.  That's huge. It's huge. So speaking of metal Bond the Twitter. I fought with a lot of Bears fans this week, but not in the way that Paul does. Oh, okay, you're saying you're not seeking out Vengeance today opportunity to Revenge tweeting. Okay, I'm not no, I'm not pulling tweets. I am friends with a lot of Bears fans a lot of bears writers. I don't know why I always befriend the enemy. Well, they're really mad about the Cordell Patterson penalty on the punt return. Yeah. It was very  Litter of alliterative the pattern Patterson punt return penalty. So I mean it probably should have been a penalty they are it's push and dots have been a penalty project. It's right over so absolutely should have been a turnovers are I think that's a legitimate gripe that they have there. That's fine. However, my me, this is 1st quarter 2nd quarter. I don't remember which second quarter of okay. So right after Tyler Irvin our new Lord and Savior who all was knocked out of the game with a finger injury, who is a purely very good. So he's the Difference Maker and then trim on.  Williams is in returning punts and and gets lit up and at full speed looked it. Definitely looked like a helmet it definitely looked like he would lead with his headquarters Patterson did and on replay you see now it's not that bad and it looks like it was kind of a bang bang play in real time. And yeah, I mean you probably shouldn't throw the flag on a bang bang play because it's not early but the Flies was thrown anyway also old Mantra man making a very rookie mistake that I mean got Dairy Shepherd cut earlier this year so not great there and they really need  Have it ribbons day. They really do everybody else know all it hurts. How can everybody be so bad at this one thing? I can't believe they don't even try Marquez valda scantling. I'm discussed but you'd be based on his measurables. I think you'd be a good kick returner. I think you'd be a terrible punt returner. Yeah. Well you have to, you know catch the ball when it's put red in your bread basket that is a prerequisite the traditionally the kick returner can have straight line speed and just half-decent Vision whereas a punt returner needs a lot.  More agility if that's what I'm yeah, that's why my cahide was always a really good punt returner but was never a good kick returner. Okay. Well in any case that was not a great, you know start for the Bears there, but they also lost by I guess that I lost by 8, but they were never really in the game. So it would have taken more than that people were arguing that because the Packers scored their first touchdown off of that penalty. Yeah, but so my counter argument, let's say that the Packers were gifted a turnover.  Packers went for it on fourth down to a pass to Devante that was incomplete and shortly after the replay showed that Buster's crying had just a full handful of Jersey. That's true a trying to break into the so that that should have been defensive pass interference. It should have been a spot file and the Packers should have continued that drive on their own 10-yard line also all true. And so it was a turnover exactly. So tit-for-tat Packers were gives it a turnover bears are gifted a turnover Bears fans get the hell out.  Of my mentions, you know, we've talked about the Packers luck with officiating this year. I still think that's the case, right it is I know that I mean with every one of these we can do this where well they got that call. They shouldn't have got that they shouldn't have gotten but then they also got burned by this other call the Packers. I still feel like at the end of the day they've gotten more calls than they haven't they've been they've been benefited this year. They've got a our luck there surely ever called for pass interference it to an absurd degree it you can't have pass interference if you only play soft Zone I mean  Kind of yeah, that's that is Kevin King and getting up in anybody's face to commit my spirit. I'm surprised there's my hit more with it. But but he's not so what actually with the screenplays that he purchased. I think Jay are because he's so small like they're like he has to play physically. I suppose they were just body him earlier speaking of Twitter. I refer to Gar Alexander as a tiny ball of anger and Swagger who I like that's dead on that is what he is imagine. I mean  you've seen him there was a lot of discussion about his ability to blow up screen passes this week. But like he still he still makes a ton of mistakes like that. Those are going to go away imagine when he's like head is full Pika Powers. He's gonna be so good man. He's been so encouraging he had a really good week actually a lot of defensive players had really good weeks. Mmm. I know it's the Bears bit of a grain of salt name. It's true Biscay, but really nice job by the defense all around. I think think we can definitively say Kenny Clark's back. He's been absolutely so since  Going to jump ahead to Kenny Clark. I need to talk about Madden for a second Dewey. Yeah, so it literally just this is completely relevant. I swear to God we'll find out Madden Ultimate Team. Do you guys know what that is? Not at all. Is that the Pro Bowl for Madden? No think of Madden meets trading cards, you get trading cards of players. They have specific stats and then you play the game with those players. So it's like strat-o-matic baseball.  I guess so. There's like fake football game inside a fake football game. Yeah, but it's more like a trading card game. Okay. Alright and then you play football with your trading card team it is it's that's okay. I'm gonna matter no mildly interested in this because it's okay over with there's specific programs and whatnot. Like in the winter. They always do out of position players. So like you can get a Calvin Johnson free safety card and you can have Calvin Johnson the free safety or  Because he played free safety on a Hail Mary one time so mad and makes him a free safety card. Okay, but anyway Kenny Clarke is this week's defensive team of the week hero. So he got a he got a ver Reeves week. He has 95 block shedding 92 strength and 91 play wreck of so, yes. He's an absolute just Monster against the run if if you have him in a in a 4-3  On the as one of your inside defensive tackles. There's no way your opponent's gonna be able to run inside. So it's funny that Madden now sees Kenny Clarke as like what all the Packer fans have seen Kenny Clarke as just in time. So the Packers win 2113 against Chicago Bears and to ticket in you down the path here the defense, I think we the one obviously the passing game is still not clicking. It's not probably never going to click and and that's the thing that's sort of been front and center for Packer.  Seems the past several years. So it feels like this is a wildly inconsistent football team. I'm starting to think that obviously that part is true, but their defense is consistent their defenses is prone to make giving up a couple big plays a game pro. They're going to get a turnover maybe two turnovers a game and they're going to hold a team to like three, you know, certainly no more than 21 points and that's pretty encouraging and now they're you know, they look at the offensive line and the running game and parts of the Special Teams not all of it part of it you start to think  to it starts to kind of as you look at that whole picture this team isn't bad there. They've got some flaws and their their passing game. He's figured out but they're really not that bad. They're not defense has come around quite a bit. I agree. It's probably won't get perfect. But with Clark starting to dominate up the middle like that. It's it causes a lot of problems and I think they've kind of found out what they like to do in the secondary at this point that there are really good not moving Tramonto round where they kind of need Savvy and  Chanin Sullivan played a really good game my gosh at the end. He made a great tackle on the last play the game too. He did you really think you'd look by the way, we're gonna see when you say they don't move trim on around. You mean like Pat Mike Patton. Yes, Mike Patton moves trim on around fine. I'm sorry. So in the in my tweet about gyre Alexander someone here we go Jonathan deal.  Tell Paul on the podcast please about gyre billing a ball of sweaty. Yes, and then I said Paul will likely counter with he's only bad because of patent. It's not his own fault also eat also EPA and baseball. Okay and Andy Chef Anne and Chef the Brewers have done a lot this week. By the way, we can totally talk about the Brewers we won't but we could maybe later. Yeah, maybe later. So the time launched against the Bears.  It's hard for me to keep whining about patent because just look I was looking at like season-long numbers this week. And the defense is holding teams now to like five fewer points this year than last year. That's a good upgrade. The offense is completely the same the average the exact same number of points per game. Yeah. I saw that you tweeted that out that surprised me. Yeah. So I mean, I think when you go back and look at the games recently, that's that's pretty much true like the offense is not great.  They're okay. They're not terrible. They're fine, but they you know have those long stretches of Badness, but the defense has been legit good against some bad offenses. But I mean the Bears literally just lit up the Cowboys last week for a total points and whatever adjustments they made against the Cowboys Mike Pettine countered completely and they went away and it was the same old bears and same old bad quarterback and David Montgomery was still terrible and it was great. So David Montgomery was terrible even though the  Packers did not have BJ goods and their best run stopping linebacker active. Correct here that less than 40 yards without their designated liquor run. Stop. My pain was telling them run against me run against my team and he played Diamond nickel the whole game didn't matter major win for Paul who has been been critical of the Bears you no love for David Montgomery. Yeah, we can't discount the fact that he's terrible. So but but also just it what's the  What's the word for a bait? I'm going to say baseball thing. What's the word for a baseball player who can't hack it in the majors, but destroys and AAA. Yeah, he's a quality player quad-a. So that's that's that's David Montgomery. That's right. I think that's that is a good cop because he did dominate College just by busting tackles and like abusing worse athletes, but you get it. It's the Ronde and problem. It's you get a big guy who relies on power up against a bunch of you know, Giant  Players who can't be overpowered and that just disappears. So hooray for David Montgomery quite idea. Cheers. Well, I actually think the packer defense might be kind of if you're looking for a reason to be optimistic in the playoffs. That's it. Like they've gotten better recently like that seems to be trending upward. They haven't they've not given up as many big plays lately either. No, it's another on this game. Definitely not in this game. They were the Bears were held pretty much in check. So  pet you noticed all of the Bears big plays came on targets of Blake Martinez. Well, I didn't notice it but I assumed it definitely should be every team strategies available in coverage. Yeah, basically any time there was a big play receiver was catching a ball two yards past Blake Martinez. It felt like Patton was was sort not asking for this but like he was he was guarding against these big plays. He was got he was he was giving them a lot. I think that's true. They tackled. Well though that kept people in front of  Let me ask you this is it relates to optimism in the playoffs? Because now we haven't even said it but the Packers are going to the playoffs. We now know this they need to win to clinch the division playoffs. It's happening. We are talking about playoffs first time in three years. The the fact that the passing game is what it is what it is and you know, Aaron Rodgers had another sort of pedestrian week and really only one receiver was making plays. Do you do you have any optimism that that part could actually click in the postseason because if it did I feel like this is a Super Bowl team right now.  I agree with that, but I don't see that how you don't see it happening is equal to minus destined to return even if he did if he's the difference between Super Bowl or not. That's I mean that's amazing that there's that means they're already a Super Bowl TS. I mean you say 1 1 receiver made plays but one that one receiver also didn't make plays in We saw a return of drop Vontae kind of out of nowhere. Like if you want to be optimistic on that front, I really think that they should just  Stop playing Marcus fell to scantling. Yeah, he had a shot that went through his hands. He's been awful. He's getting too many snaps like put lisara to but Kumar O3 and just go with that. I think that's that's solid make like pull the pull the Billy Beane Carlos Pena trick here, like get Val the scaling like off the field off the team if you need to I think I don't know what Allison to I mean I use so bad. I forgot existed. I definitely agree with you and Allison on the other hand with  The scantling let me ask you this. Would it make more would it because the the pass goes through his hands terrible look doesn't get doesn't sniff another real opportunity there totally understandable, but he had he had his men beat he did his job is does it make sense to go back to that? Well, at least one more time in the game to try and make that work again or is that just is it just blown to Pieces? It might make sense. You also have to you know, get that route open again. I mean he beat that guy but if their safeties over the top then it's not there and yeah.  Well, or or if haha, so over the top well, you know house back far enough to prevent that from happening most of the time and he is everything he absolutely fulfills the haha. Yeah. Yeah, honestly, you know, I actually haven't really checked off that box yet because I wrote earlier in the season about how how much better Amos has than huh? And how has actually had not a terrible season like his PFF grades, although they're usually pretty good even though he's bad. He's actually made some decent tackles and weeks past but been he was everything he  He was completely hot this game. He was just awful hilariously. So just great. Haha Clinton Dicks. So far in the season is credited with five missed tackles here five in this game. He had guaranteed one in this game that the long pass to coomera. Yep. Ha ha just like whiffed. You can't miss tackles. You don't attempt though, right? That is true you tempted so well, that's what that's why generally he doesn't have a lot of missed tackles because I mean usually he's just running up to a guy who's already on the ground and you can't miss that tackle. Its  Impossible so week one of haha sophomore season the Packers played the Bears and it was it was pretty sloppy game in terms of field conditions him and Sam Shields just could not stay on their feet. I don't know if you guys remember like they wouldn't change their cleats and they were slipping all over the place. I vaguely remember a not changing cleat story and so Shields fell down a bunch and haha whiffed a bunch of tackles. So I sent this song  Keep your head up to both of them on Twitter and haha blocked me for it the so it is now four years later. I'm still blocked and ha ha ha still can't tackle. So like nothing is changed. Everything is the same to everybody who hasn't seen the the GIF of haha missing the tackle on Camaro. It is hilarious. Awesome with the chicken wing. Yep nagler tweeted it first. You can go see it on his I have a I have a slo-mo version from the  Back side of it which I think is a little bit better. I want to put Chariots of Fire over it. It's just amazing. All right, I will do that and aside from that obvious missed tackle. He also he had chances to stop Aaron Jones and I think Davante Adams from scoring and just stopped running. There's a great one where he I think it's Jones were he's chasing him very slowly down and bakhtiari comes just out of nowhere and completely catches up to her Clinton Dicks from like 10 yards behind even though he's not  Trying to make a tackle and isn't going to block anybody. So I don't know what got into him. It was just a vintage game. Is it the one where Jones like left amukamara in the dust like Rand left? It was left. He scored in the left corner. So yeah, I think that's right. Yep. That's yeah, that was it. I was like so one of the friends I had over was playing against someone with Aaron Jones on their fantasy team and he got up to go get another beer and I yelled up to the kitchen. Hey Luke. Yeah, Aaron just scored.  From 15 yards out God damn it.  Anyway, it's depressing to me that the second area the Bears is fairly, you know mediocre at best and that they needed a want they needed a 49-yard play from Jake umm, bro, and that was it from him and they needed, you know, like they just they just they just aren't enough play makers out there. I know we say it every week but it's so frustrated that the they only were able to do just enough against that secondary it is annoying, but they if they're going to overthrow to Devante they at least did move them around a lot.  And they got him in some favorable matchups at least made it easy for Aaron to throw to him too much slot fungus flottante. So everybody should also go watch the Devonte fourth down touch down in slow motion because Buster's grind like literally jumps on his back and Devante just walks into the end zone with him riding his back and that that's a really nice play call from the floor to get actually that would look that was a play call from Rogers. Well, okay, so the floor called a slant  To get the first down Rogers saw Pressman with haha over the top and checked to go route. Did you see the overlay video of Rogers explaining what he saw on the pasta Kumar? Oh, you must have we did because our colleague died because he made it. Oh, he made it. What's I haven't seen you? How did you not see that? The health department was here today. I didn't have time. All right. Well, yes really gave me chills are expecting company colleague Peter because he made a just brilliant video of  The Camaro play or overlaid with Aaron Rodgers explaining what he sees and like rewinding it back and forth with Rogers talking over it. It's great. Everybody should go check it out. It's very nerdy X's and O's but it's like wow, he really gonna disappear for the next 54 seconds. I'm currently watching it. Yeah, it's really really good. But so it was good that they moved on to it around its they got him singled up on screen who cannot cover Devante and the only other time he did it he interfered with them, but it would have also been nice to see them like  Get Lazard on I'm a chimera and abuse that a little bit just move people away from Fuller in general and just pick on the weak areas of the bear secondary because there are weak areas of the very secondary, you know getting Devonte in space. That's fine. That's a good strategy but they gotta start spreading it around to more than just a man. Yeah Camaro had the one big catch but it was kind of a fluke nice play. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It was a little fluke. I would say it wasn't a fluke that to gain like 20 yards on that play, right?  The extra 29 yards were of what do you think? We've obviously talked many times. Why it why does it LM Lazard has not gotten a fair Shake throughout his career. We're still not seeing him fully know the great. They still seem to have like moved Allison and Geronimo gets all these targets and I'm confused he drops half of them and I wish I had a good explanation for it other than Lazar does have some high-profile mentals mistakes on tape of just about reading the right route. That might be a big  Art of it Allison's, you know more of a veteran he's been in the offense longer but the like Lazard also like he shows up on tape in run blocking and doing all kinds of other cool little stuff. So literally every play of them running at Lazard. He looked like ass like a like a stretched-out marcedes Lewis. He's a monster and run blocking. He's really good at it. He's so the neck Brandon Marshall I'm saying it right now actually think that's not a bad cop Brandon Marshall was like the best blocking receiver in history of football.  I don't know if that's a little too much but but I don't know why they're not giving Lazard more more reps. I think he's still obviously better than everybody else and should be the to and every time they have Allison or mvs featured on a play is just a waste. So no idea why keeps happening. That's a change that could make that would legitimately help the offense a lot. But at least they got a big game on a Devonte by doing a good job getting him and good position. So it still should have scored more though left a lot of play.  It's on the table. Here is why I feel like this game is essentially karmic Kickback for the the Wisconsin, Illinois game took place in Champaign earlier this year that Illinois inexplicably one. There's a lot of reasons why I think the Packers should have lost this game. The biggest one is a series of three plays at the end of the first half that were just at Roshan this gracious. What was Aaron doing on those? It's Aaron Rodgers throwing incomplete not making it back to the line of scrimmage for the pay for the intentional grounding penalty the inexplicable.  Draining of the clock that happened after that and then a pass down the field on Fourth and 14 that gave the Bears a chance where they would not have had if there had been a running player a pond or whatever and then so series of laterals from the defense that would have opened up the thread of a fumble to let the Bears score a garbage, you know, first have garbage time touchdown. I could have swung the whole thing inexplicable. Who did he Target on Fourth and 14. I don't know. Is that the vato shoot I missed it. Everyone's Geronimo Duffy course it was Geronimo.  Ooh, and the pass was low. But you're on internal could have caught it. Maybe that's what you carry could have got if he catches it. Then the clock runs do nothing against nothing. All it did was give the Bears a chance like throwing a Hail. Mary would have also killed the clock and giving them a chance to score a point throwing to the sidelines would have given him a chance to get a field goal doing that just does nothing good. Honestly. It was I think it was the 3 worst plays of the year back to back to back really she's he likes it was such a bad sequence and did not hurt them so it won't be remembered.  Such but honestly those three plays are inexplicable. I mean that's got to be Aaron. I can't believe little would like direct to pass down the middle and that situation like what is what's he doing there that such bad situational awareness. They were a hundred percent scramble drill at that point. Why in the hell that you're Animo scramble to the middle of the field? Who knows no idea. That's why he was open because he was in the middle of the goddamn field. I then think the Packers  I really almost gimme the clearly almost gave up points on the final play of the second half. That's who the crazy series of laterals, you know upon further review knowing that only I forget the guys name the guy who fumbled the ball the fullback for the Bears have you to get Bear full back? He's the only guy who could have recovered the ball in the end zone for it to not have been a penalty. So like the Packers were not it wasn't literally down to the two yard line, but it was close enough. Well, I mean if he sees Allen Robinson to his right right and pitches it to him. He probably scores.  And also to get the two point conversion, but like whatever that could have been a disaster could it was very close to a disaster and not to mention the Hail Mary that went out of the guy's hands. That's a good point too. That was not a well-defended hill Mario that played did not get the first got a couple guys going up trying to knock the ball down trying for the interception and then it deflects to the back of the end zone and bears receiver just dropped it. You could have had it. I mean it was not like an easy catch, but he dropped that ball for the most part and that would have been disastrous.  Okay, those are a lot of almost disasters your head II don't know how they escape they the things that what I related to Wisconsin, Illinois because there were a lot of things that just that game was also the everything went wrong game. That's true. That didn't happen the Packers. There were a lot of things that could go wrong with just didn't but there's no real explanation for why they didn't so I I I do think they got lucky as much as I think the defense, I mean, they balled out the offense of get on the field in the second half. They, you know, run three plays chip off a minute and be off the field in the defense was right back on there were clearly  And they definitely did their part. They definitely did the prepares own the time of possession. So I really do think that they did play well, but this is a this is a lucky win. I know people kind of realize that it's just we have so many lucky wins this year. So many so it's funny that you say that like, everything went right. Do you know the last time the Packers had an involvement with the fumble in the fourth quarter rule? Nope. Tell December December.  T14 the everything went wrong game against Buffalo. Oh, I do vaguely remember that game, but nothing about I don't remember that came at all. Why don't I remember that game at all. It was a Packers got shellacked got just destroyed Yeah by a bad team. I really really terrible Buffalo team. I remember that being in Buffalo but winning that's when Nick Barnett was still on the team and I don't remember them being Buffalo since then. So 2014 they went to Buffalo like week three is that early on it was like week 16  Did they not go to the playoffs or did that not impact their playoff Destiny for some reason it changed their seating but they still made the playoffs. But anyway, Jordi dropped a sure hand like it was like Jordi up the seam for it was like I think the past was 20 are yards and Jordi dropped it. So, you know once what was the fumble Aaron Rodgers fumbles into the end zone in the fourth quarter and it can't be once it was recovered. It can't be moved forward. And so I ended up being a safety.  He tried to he tried to like run out of the am I remind misremembering really good because I know Rogers had a fumble safety in 2014, but I'm all it also might have been against the Cardinals. I think at one point Aaron Rodgers are at had no. No, it was yeah had to be 2014 because Eddie Lacy tried to recover it and move it out of the end zone. How could that be a safety also going into the field Aaron Rodgers fumbled into the end zone? Oh got it.  Eddie Lacy tried to pick it up and run with it, but it was ruled down where it was recovered because it's because of yes, he's the whole ear. Okay. I totally get it. Yes. So the Packers are backed up into their end of the field. I was picturing that they were trying to score about to score. Okay? Yes, so I referred to the fumblerooski against the Bears as the Aaron Rodgers rule just to make just to make Bears fans even more man Holy Roller one of the better one of the better terminology.  Under used terms in the NFL football fun time can't Ken Stabler has so many named games. Yeah, it's just it's so he's got goes to the post. Okay? I haven't heard that one. But I believe that one either. It's he won a game with a post route to Casper. Okay, call them ghosts. Okay. I've got it. He's got the Holy Roller.  And the other sort of death focused ones. Yeah. All right. This is sipper the Sea of hands that was just created. Is that Diego Maradona? I had to content of guy you have hand of God. So yeah, that's like he threw of he threw a pass into a huge crowd of people in the end zone. So he'll marry Dave caspase open, Wisconsin. So yeah can stay there has a lot of named games. It's just it's always been kind of interesting to me how  Like important games he's played and I think that's why he made the hall but that's a that's another pot. Yeah agreed. So also I want to mention real quick. Za'darius was a little quiet in that game. But he also did cause the dean Lowrey interception on an awesome stunts. So he which kind of the biggest play of the game a kind of saved them. They were in a little bit of trouble until that happened, but it a little bit of a quack in from the outside guys, generally and I think a little bit by Design I do you  Think they sort of focused on getting pressure up the middle both spying on true Biscay and just making them uncomfortable back there. So very good game plan in that capacity. I think the The Smiths were charged with containing him and not letting him get outside. And once once Nagy saw that he stopped rolling too risky out and made him terrible. So yeah, nothing patented. Well, very nice. Nicely called Defensive game and also terrible but shouldn't awful job.  Nagy who I thought was a much better Coach than he apparently is he seems to be having a rough year. Let's back up about six seconds. Yeah. What was that? What was that that you said? Nice job by Patton. Oh my god. Oh, man. He did. He did a nice job all the fan huge fan. Let's see how the evidence is out noted. Mike Pettine fan. It was the Bears. So we'll see what happens going forward major bummer. That's Darius Smith is not a pro bowler. I'm not smart. I haven't paid attention the rest of the league enough to know like who's  Ting in front of them but like come on, how is he should definitely be a parole or it's stupid nature bummer major beers. There's only one Pro Bowl controversy that I want to talk about. What's that in the official Packers? Press release of Aaron Rodgers and David bakhtiari making the Pro Bowl. Oh, yeah. Aaron Rodgers is an inch and a half taller than David bakhtiar this Drew just like in real life and they even Photoshopped it. So bakhtiari shoulder was in front of Aaron so it wouldn't even be  Like an issue with scaling in a trick of the eye. They legitimately Photoshop Aaron Rodgers to be taller.  Now, let's be honest. Neither of them should have made the Pro Bowl. So it's missing this controversy shouldn't exist how very important it makes more sense. Actually that a very tall version of Aaron Rodgers would make the Pro Bowl Rogers. So I'm okay with it. I think that I'm on board with the Photoshop 6-foot only be six foot five. Aaron Rodgers is the man. Well, they literally they pick the wrong Aaron and they picked the wrong time the wrong tactile totally agree. Yep. Absolutely.  Aaron Rodgers, cause I know you listen to reporting at eligible eligible. Nobody cares how tall you are. Nobody is bothered by the fact that you're six to or whatever like you're going to Hall of Fame. Yeah, you're taller than Drew Brees you write your table and Russell Wilson. Yeah. No one no one cares. You're amazing. It's father have been amazing. Like it's not a big deal. No one cares. I met Doug Flutie one time. He small man. He is Tiny. So Doug Flutie, I believe is listed as 510. Mmm. Me too. I'm  I'm 5-9 without my shoes on I'm a good inch taller than him. He's a he's a wee one is short but yet a nice a nice cock college career, at least I mean it is it is amazing that well. I mean like I know we you know, the height height doesn't really matter ultimately but like it is amazing that Russell Wilson and Drew Brees who now set yet another NFL record at their height are capable of doing what they're doing. It is astounding to me, it's astounding I also think this is  People are just wrong about for a long time that height matters. Yeah, at least at that level like maybe if you'd like five five, you can't play quarterback. But if you're just a normal sized person, I just don't think it matters at all. It depends. I mean it clearly does not matter at all. But we've had plenty of evidence now that that normal hated people can be good quarterbacks and Rogers and plenty of evidence that tall quarterbacks are often bad for being tall like a cosmic Brock Osweiler, of course being the prototypical  Sample, but there's not a lot of good big ones. There's a couple like Matt Ryan's giant man, and he's fine and Roethlisberger's a freaking monster and he was okay in his prime, but by and large those guys flame out like I'd give me the short guys any day of the week Roethlisberger the advantage he has isn't even just as hide it. No just shaking guys off. He's also I'm pretty sure Roethlisberger's listed it like 260 like if that dudes 260, I'm 145. Yeah. He probably was 260 in high school. Yeah, I probably was before he filled out. Yeah.  Filled up boy. I mean, he's a good old hiya boy. I don't know if you guys ever been to Fricker's that's pretty good Wing joint. You could you could pack on some elby's there. Yeah, sounds delicious last Entre Biscay. We've made fun of him all year. Yeah. Let's do it. Again. We should definitely continue to make fun of him. Is there any chance that the there were some preseason predictions that he was going to evolve past here in Rogers? We've seen Aaron Rodgers slip backwards a little bit to Biscay is fairly mobile. We didn't, you know, like you talked about the game plan to take that away from him is there  Any chance he becomes effective in the NFC NFC North? I think it takes a unique game plan to make them effective. He's I think I think he would thrive in Greg Roman scheme. Yeah, I think that's fair. But then you just did you just compare him to Kaepernick? Yes. He like he's not quite like a panic because he's not as fast but that's your best. That is your only chance with him. I think because he's not going to be a good pocket passer. He's just not accurate enough. We've seen this enough now to know that he's not going to take a step forward with accuracy.  He ever does you can't blame his weapons like Al Robertson's good? I tell her Gabriel. I think's pretty good is tight ends are terrible but those two receivers are really good. Yeah, Anthony Miller and Miller is incredible. I had a great game but like you seems to be good. It's hard to judge completely withdrew risky because he also disappears. Sometimes you just called him bad last week. Well, I'm not sure he's good. I will actually kind of Stand by that a little bit. I don't he did have a good game, but he had a good game. But I mean, he said he could give us  He's had a lot of bad games. I want to see him with a like an average quarterback before I say is good and I think Alan Robinson is objecto. Robinson's good. We've seen him with lots of different kinds of quarterbacks and he's always good as long as he's healthy. So you can't blame that on this is just not a good picture. Whiskey's just bad. I hope I hope he finishes the season well and they pick up his option and keep them around for a while. But yeah lines announcer keeping Patricia around. Yes, that team is just  Honestly, I don't think we can even judge the lines. They've had so many injuries. I have no idea but but my Patricia isn't making them I mean better but we when your injury depleted then you trade away your starting safety. There's like what are you there? That was strange that I mean that's not produced his fault. That's the front office's fault too. But I also think there's going to be quite a few openings this offseason. And if you're the lions are you going to do better because you're not the best organization you're not going to attract the best coaches that are out there if there's  Petition for them you're going to end up with the bottom feeder. So I think that plays into it a good amount to and yeah, you can give them another chance because that team was a mess and Stafford's entire now, by the way, so we're not facing him in the last week of the say but yeah, he's not a good coach. So hooray for keeping him around to man. I really think less the NFC North I really think the Lions could blow up all over the place. Oh boy real quick to go back.  Few things Bring Me Greater Joy than seeing a big man like Dean Lowrey catching a ball straight in his face and picking it off TJ Watts style. That's Reaction Time by Dean incredible and like you said, maybe the play the game. I think there's a couple possibilities, but that one I wish it had led to the sustained drive that ended the game, but it doesn't matter if it was glorious fat man with a football especially on an athletic play like that. Imagine the Bears imagine being on your opponent's 27 and then taking a sack for 11-yard loss on third down.  It's it's it's not what you want. No, no, it's bad owner shot Gary with a big sack by the way on first. Yes. Yeah. That's not a bad game for a shot Gary. Well done. He's showing some flashes. I hate it when guys show flashes because not consistent enough, but better than that I said, no because then you get Nick Perry who shows enough lashes to get a brilliant damn dick Parry. That better not end up being a good comp. Yeah. So Nick Perry was a good athlete because he was a tweener rochon, Gary.  Just a great athlete. That's true. He's a big dude. That's that's fine. It is interesting that they took him as sort of the project is the higher of the two first-round draft picks. I mean, I think this is exactly what they could have. Hope for wishon Gary not that you're like confident. He'll be as he'll be a solid contributor extra bit of the probably trending that direction and then Savaged a later pick is the guy who's like, you know, a guy you rely on it again game two, he was all over the place and he also seems to be kind of picking it up towards the end of the season here. So what it tells me  The Gary pick was based on the faith in Preston and za'darius. Yeah, that that they purposely picked someone who they figured could be like a top-five edge rusher because they knew they didn't need him for a couple years. Yeah, I agree with you. That's very logical. So we'll go so far that is playful laid out perfectly if that's what I'm doing. I had a couple logical takes someone was complaining about Danny Vitali snap counts.  He only had nine snaps against the Bears. Yeah, and my argument was that he's arguably the worst back in pass protection out of the three-man backs, man. I mean, he's the only one with multiple whiffed. He's not the best. That's for sure yet. But like when he's the sixth Locker, he's had multiple missed Blitz pickups. And even though Aaron Jones had a pretty bad Game Pass protection. Why's he got pushed back a few times? But no one should number no one should  Complain about Danny Vitaly not getting enough playing time like he's gimmick player if his gimmick isn't there when he's in the game that gonna keep him until it shows up. He's going to get his chances and they'll be out. So stop complaining about I wonder if they would use Batali more but Jamal Williams and Aaron Jones just blossomed like they have this year. You just don't yeah, there's do it. There's no reason to do it. I think that's that's a ton of it. Like there's no reason to ever take him out. I use a more instead of Jimmy Graham. Well, okay put him in a tight end.  It's fine. I would like to see that kind of creativity but he's also not a tight end, you know, like he doesn't practice their he doesn't run their routes. So once I had him out of bed like you're fast and big I'm going to turn you into a tight end, but he's not one. I mean Jimmy Graham's not a tight end either. He's just he was Jimmy was one. Yeah, he was once we even then even it is best. He was a I mean, he literally filed a grievance with the league saying he wasn't a Titan.  Like everyone forgets this. Yep, Jimmy Graham personally defines himself as not at Ida. I know. Oh Peter brought this up at ABC the other day is Jimmy Graham the most likely offensive Hall of Famer that Rogers has played with. Oh, no. Yeah absolutely hundred percent right? I think he is. I mean, he doesn't have the edge of my seat mate unless it's like bakhtiar your belaga Nelson's not gonna party is not going to make it. Jack's not gonna make it.  Maybe some like bye Tre maybe but probably not. Yeah, I mean we can all dream on air and Jones, I guess at this point. I suppose if a running back of this generation ever goes into the Hall of Fame, but he's that I don't think he's well ranaut Regatta. I mean that is so it's probably Jimmy Graham which is seems kind of insane a little criminal. Yeah a little-little unfortunate.  Yeah, so when when Aaron Rodgers is 40 and Randy Moss or his equivalent is available. Brian gue should do what what Ted Thompson did not so what I mean outside of sharp, obviously Favre had  Keith Jackson who didn't isn't in the Hall of Fame but was close-ish. Obviously Risin other resident in the Hall of Fame not I don't actually I don't know. I can't tell you the MLB Hall of Famers. But yeah, I mean you're talking about an era of football where there were there's no receivers in yeah, there was multiple Hall of Famers on the field of the same time. There's no way Andre ricin would ever even be flirted with yeah. I don't I guess I don't know offhand. Anyways, I'm saying I don't think Favre did either okay fair enough Sterling.  Harp is certainly sharp is not an all right, it's his brother in his Hall of Fame. Speech said Sterling was better. That's probably factually true different positions. Yeah. Yeah. So Shannon Shannon said that he's the only member of his family in the Hall of Fame and he's the second best football player. That's probably true Sterling Sharpe was astounding if he doesn't get hurt, he's like slam dunk. So it's okay fair point. I guess part of hasn't had anybody either. Yeah. So I mean like if Sterling had extended his career a couple more years Favre had a Hall of Famer.  Outside like I mean name a Packers offense Hall of Famer since Lofton. Yeah, you're right. It's quarterbacks. So speaking of running backs that are that are at potential Hall of Fame caliber. If you project them in the most optimistic way possible Dalvin cook might not play actually. Sounds like you pretty much won't yep. How big of a deal is that? How big is it? How much does that impact with the Packers are going to do against the Vikings here in week 16. I'm going to I'm going to say it. Say it again.  For the millionth time Dalvin cook is the straw that stirs the drink of the Vikings offense. So does that mean they will have to be environmentally friendly and not use a straw when they drink is that what's happening? If I were talking if the Packers come out to any sort of a lead, it's going to force Kirk Cousins to throw a lot more and it's going to go very poorly. I think that's a fair read. I do think he's important to that offense Madison, who is I forget his full? I think it's Alexander mad.  Sin is his backup is a pretty good Dalvin cook like a prince of a troubled him before right? Yeah, and he's been hurt too. He was upgraded to questionable today and we'll probably play that helps the Vikings caused quite a bit if he does play but yeah not having Cooks a big deal. It's he makes a lot of easy throws for cousins takes a lot of pressure off of him. And if the Vikings happen to get a lead, it's not going to be as safe as it generally would be because cook is if  Else one of the best clock killers there is so it's a big deal and they've been good. They've been really good this year, but I do think that cook is a more important running back than your average running back is and his loss is pretty significant.  I haven't done a lot of the breakdown on the tiebreakers but Packers got a huge break when Atlanta beat San Francisco with the buzzer San Francisco and Seattle both basically need to lose once more San Francisco cratering a bit. By the way. They've had some big problems getting healthy on defense and they are having I could tell you as someone who has counted on them and fantasy all you deliver a shout outs. Like they have been trash for like three weeks in a row now basically since the Packer game that was gonna say the Packers game might be the high point of their seat prop very,  Might be so those two teams play in the last week of the Season remains to be seen if Packers will have a horse in that race or I mean ideally one of those teams will lose this week both would be at the most ideal and then you get you get one more loss for the other team and week 17 and if those if that happens if they both take one loss the Packers can win out and get that number one seed inexplicably could be the number one seed in the west. They they could do it. I personally think they're most likely to get the three. I think that if you expect them to lose to Minnesota, which I kind of still  Will do New Orleans is in the driver seat. Unless New Orleans losses to Carolina and week 17. It's a Carolina could happen. I mean Atlanta beat both New Orleans and San Francisco. So, you know, that's not terrible there. Okay there. Okay, we saw Isabel. So if that happens the Packers can still stay ahead of New Orleans, but that that would have to happen. There's there's almost no way that they can bypass and worlds on the strength of Victory tiebreaker and get in if the loss is this next one against, Tennessee for New Orleans.  So the Packers pretty much they really need to win this game against Minnesota to keep that first round by that's going to be huge. Yeah, if they're going to be actual serious contenders, they need to finish off the season here and get that that buys super important for them. Yeah, but Vikings by the way are this second best team in the NFC by Point differential? They only Trail San Francisco and given San Francisco's recent struggles. There's a good argument to be made that the Vikings are actually the best team in the NFC so  Dang, that's kind of what you're looking at right now. They're they're good. They've had a really good season of people haven't paid attention since last time they played cousins has been one of the best quarterbacks in the league and they've actually struggled a bit on defense. Well, one of the weirdest stories for them is Xavier roads got terrible really fast. Yeah, he fell off a cliff. Oh, yeah Rose secondary in general has not because true Wayne's is gonna there's also has taken a bit of a dive from yeah. We saw that coming. I'll see here's the  If I thought it was gonna be like the best defensive player in the NFL in like in like a year disappeared. He's not you don't hear his name at all anymore. You do not serve it. He's been one of the best defensive players for quite a while. Yeah. I know. I know so I checked this morning. The line is Minnesota - four and a half. Hmm, which in Minnesota is a really good line for the Packers. That means that uh neutral field its Minnesota by one and a half. Yeah.  Which is ridiculous.  So that that means that I think that lines about right given your soul. So we're talking about how the Packers have ugly wins. They do Viking and the Vikings are one of the best teams in the league they are but you're okay with a to new point spread. Yeah. Well the Vikings schedule hasn't been great either. Yeah. I don't trust them that much and like yes, the Packers keep getting lucky, but they also keep having one score games like so it wouldn't be surprising for me if they had a ones.  Game against the Vikings here win or lose and that's about where the spread lies. So that's fine. Also, the Vikings are on3 against teams with a winning record, right? That's what I'm saying. And they are notoriously bad on Monday night. Not that that's that's a mumbo-jumbo said that no one should really care about but they have beaten up on bad teams. So they have that going for beat the hell out of some bad team. Yeah.  The Packers have beaten some bad teams defeating them. Not not as badly as they should've but okay. So let's see slainte. I think it's questions now. I mean we could talk about how Tyler Ervin is our Lord and savior some more we don't get a chance quick quick plug to Peter Bukowski. Again. He said the Packers are eight in success between the 20 and the 40 on both sides of the field and third in the Red Zone, but their 27th between the 40s.  That's it. That's been pretty consistent for a couple of years now and Tyler Urban Tyler Ervin you are the MVP ervin's getting a 40 in the fourth. I do think a lot of that is Rogers is pretty good at punching the ball into the end zone. He's still pretty good hard-throwing short passenger and makes good decisions. But he does the kind of the same thing between the 20s and that when you have to string those together, I mean when you're getting down to the end zone you get four shots to get in.  He's pretty good at doing that between the 20s. He does that like the same thing and it takes you know, 12 to 16 players to move between the 20s if you do that because they're all short and execute. There's a good chance when you do that, you're not going to execute three of them in a row properly at some point either to Shorter incomplete or you can throw it up to your number-one receiver. Who's going to flail his arms. You can do that Leo and DPI is going to get you into side the 20 the referees love them.  So Green Bay Packers and 2019. They do that's what I'm saying referees. Love them some Green Bay Packers since the Fail Mary pretty much. It's been what it's been a pretty nice attempt at settling setting things. Right speaking of playoff seeding. If the Fail Mary never happened, San Francisco has to go into Green Bay and then they probably win anyway, yeah because we had no answer for that offense. So I mean they did go to Green Bay the next year and they still want sorry granted. It was a walk-off field goal, but it  That felt like that's what it probably one of the least remembered one, you know, like last-second wins or losses in Packers playoff history because everyone wrote off the Packers the 49ers pretty much handled it. They just it was just really close game fair enough what we got in those questions between that got some questions. Yeah, let's do it. How do this one first? Jonathan deal. Would Aaron Rodgers winning a second Super Bowl make been Baldwin more or less insufferable and I gotta I gotta start with that because I had to concede something to band which is I still have to look into this more.  But Jameis Winston actually passed Aaron Rodgers in EPA per play this we know and you know, Jamis has 24 deceptions on the year. It has been like in terms of other stats has been good like throws the ball downfield at a high completion a little bit of a bounce back here for him. So I thought I still kind of think this but I looked into it and I was wrong that EPA under rates the cost of turnovers. So I was like, I'm going to look at Winston's turnovers and look at what EPA said.  They were worth versus what actually happened on the subsequent drive when the other team got the ball and I was wrong EPA was actually harsher on Jameis Winston than real life was in real life. He has barely been punished at all for his interceptions. The other team is committed like three turnovers on the next play. There's been three missed field goals by other teams after his turnovers. So like his interceptions have actually mattered less than you would expect them to by about nine points. So  I was wrong Ben was right. He actually appears to have not been hurt that bad by a bunch of his stupid interceptions that he throws. Anyway, if Rogers got another ring would be awesome and it would make been super insufferable and make him tweet about how Rings don't matter in terms of judging individual players. So that would be great if that happened just for that reason alone. So I hope it does also because I'm a fan and I want them to win but it's a nice side benefit everything changes if they get one more ring Ted Thompson gets remember differently, even though he won't  He doesn't get credit for this team. But link he'll get a little bit of credit for it. You know, like we could still be adored, you know, everything changes that that second ring just is going to reframe everything. So the last sorry I got to the last four games for Jameis Winston three of them. He beat the hell out of bad teams and will end in one of them. It was a shootout. Yep. So he was asked to throw the ball of per trillion times.  Yeah, you gotta look at the situation man. Like I know Aaron Rodgers went something like 16 of 30 this week. It was you said quite a few rough games in a row now, but if mvs catches that that pass that's fewer attempts because that drive ends. It's an extra touch down. It is another 50 yards. I know I know and it is so instead of having like a 20  Bre dad like a 70 because of that one pass. So like I tend to be an analytical versus you know, film feel whatever the hell people say, you know, establish the run. So that is that is one of those situations where you do have to look at the at the film more than the stats fair enough, but that second half for right 100% but I'm just saying like this stats would look way.  Way better with that one pass. Yeah that happens a lot to a lot of players. So it's true though. Next question I want to do I want to do Steve's here addressed specifically to me because I Steve Steve G BL s 207 Stevia bought but he has to good question. So probably not about it like that about you mentioned in the Washington game. He listened to the podcast is not a bot you mentioned in the Washington game that they may have discovered how to stop the offense pretty definitively with secondary playing for  Back basically flipping the secondary with TBS and only rushing for did the Bears take any notes on that or was the offense just mostly bad this week. So the Bears can always play that way. They don't do too much blitzing. They have, you know, a front for that doesn't require blitzing about film academics are awesome. So they did play that way. I don't know if it's because they learned it or because it's just kind of a normal thing. But yeah that they're a bad matchup for the Packers because they can play with a stacked secondary without dedicating blisters.  To the pass rush. So yeah little a little B, but we'll see see what the Vikings do next week excited and they do that. They can the Vikings that would be a little bit of a change in Philosophy for them. If they didn't puts it all they they do some not not a ton simmers still kind of a rush for guy, but it would be a good idea for the Vikings because they're secondary is a little weak. So it it could use that sort of extra a few bodies to keep the Packers in check. It's been weird, huh?  It not seem blitzing it is it's too weird. I keep thinking. Oh, they're going to Let's Take a Look. Let's take a look. Let's not and then like you you look for others to be like, oh find the hot route, but it just doesn't happen in any game like it's just him but back there buying time and running around. So even even when rushing for Zimmer's a big fan of stunting specifically on the inside with the meteoric rise of Elton Jenkins and no longer having a black hole at right Right Guard. I'm really interested to see how Zimmer handles that now that the Packers  Have an interior to the offense of line that can handle his weird scheming. Like I don't know. I think the more I think out loud the better I feel about the game. That makes sense. Yeah, it does that he's a good stunt stopper. It makes sense. I'm on board with that a little bit still. I still think they liked it lit up on defense. I'm still you know, I said, I praise petting a lot this week, but this is a good test for the defense. So we'll see.  Rumor is that thielen is gonna play so, yep. Not sure if that's good or bad depends on if he's not that healthy. It's not that good at create a thing and that injury seemed really bad. So but I guess you wouldn't play if he was hurt. Yeah, who's the guy that bears the guy who left the shoulder right away who gutted it out and then couldn't the on defense but Hakeem Hicks. Yeah, I was gonna say he's like one of their best players. Why can't I come up with his name John amazing?  Yeah, but he was still a monster. Even with one arm. I know I don't know how he did it. But you had to think at that point. He's either not coming back or he's going to be completely were useless. I don't know how these NFL guys do it and that's not an isolated incident that happens all the time. I know it's I know or at all toward all to hurdle in Vicodin, but even then you have to well, I guess maybe the Vicodin even helps the mental side of it. I don't know you have to be able to pick up through that Vicodin turned Aaron Rodgers from Northern, California into a southern drunkard.  That was awesome. Maybe that's what they need to do. If they get in the playoffs is slip Aaron Rodgers a bunch of those drugs Vicodin got regret far three MVPs. Okay. There you go. All right. We got Joe Rasmussen. What do you think about the ugly wins? Count the same discourse that is emerged in recent weeks. I'll add to that. What do you think about the their battle tested they if they're they're well prepared for the playoffs because of close games I get it, but also think it's disingenuous.  Tenuous when evaluating the true potential of the team. So I mean I it's good to get close wins because it's good for your season. What it isn't is a good predictor going forward of your continued ability to win and I don't think it helps you prepare for the playoff atmosphere anything like that it I think as always it's better to blow teams out even good teams if you can but you know, it's not a  Thing that has happened, it's fine. Just what we can worry about that next year and boy, are we going to worry about that next year, but I don't know anybody think a couple a couple years ago. I looked at just the seeds of the teams that won the Super Bowl and it was a pretty even distribution between I mean, obviously the ones and twos at the home-field advantage had more but you saw some you saw a couple sixes. You saw some fives some threes. I mean not to say that it's an even shot for everybody but  Just getting into the playoffs. You can absolutely it does not matter where you came from. You can absolutely run this thing and tournament with a single-elimination tournament, right? Lots of funny things happen, like it small sample size throws all that out the window all the the margin of Victory does is tell you, you know, two fundamental level how good the team is but you know in the playoffs at a certain level everybody's pretty good and a few bounces make all the difference. Yeah. Well, I also think that there are different kinds of ugly wins. This week's ugly win.  Was much less ugly than the ugly win against Dallas where they almost gave up a 30-point lead. Sure. Like I think that I think that you learn more from an ugly quote unquote ugly one like this, then you do like that. I also think along with the along with the sentiment that people are unhappy with the ugly wins is just I guess for me there is still a little bit of this team is overachieving and I don't like to be the guy who's like if you'd said before the season that they would 11 games. That's how you go like,  Like I hate that but at the same time they have over achieved and the fact that they are winning ugly even though they clearly aren't gonna an elite team. So to speak in can still be the number one seed in the NFC like there has to be a little bit of just a spent like suspend your critical eye for a moment just be like there they've already achieved more than you expected. Enjoy. Enjoy. What's left. Like it doesn't need to be beautiful if they if they win a game if they go on the road and win in Minnesota by five by two points, that's a massive success at this point. They've won the division, so  I guess that's that's the part that bothers me. Not not I mean I get what I get why you want to evaluate the team as a playoff Contender as a Super Bowl Contender, you know, they're going to the playoffs or at least strongly suspect it. So you don't you don't need to look at simply do they win or not? There has to be more than that. But there's also just this like teeth-gnashing over a team that you know, most T. Most people could not have foreseen winning. This many games. Like you have to just love it. It's funny that you mention that because I noticed the tonal  shift after seven wins because right now it wasn't about a winning season there was more because it was it was no longer. This is the Plucky team that's coming bounce back here and blah blah blah. Once they pass seven wins. It was we are playoff bound and we are now going to look at them with the entitled Town mentality. And this is the Packers that we know let's forget that it's a rookie head coach. Let's forget that there's a bunch of free agents it like like they've got seven wins. There's a very very good chance at the playoffs were pissed off now.  Yeah, that's true. That happens. I do think there's also like some confusing about the concepts like what Jr. Said like you should be happy that they've done this like that. They've won these give it doesn't matter in the season you're in how they win those games and you know things also change like they were not a great team in 2010 when they won the Super Bowl for most of the season, right and they were pretty they were a great team the last like three weeks. It works racing the last three weeks of the season and that happens sometimes if that happens. I mean, that's  A change in in your team and it happens in 2007 and happens in 2011. It happens in 2012. When the Ravens win 2012. Yeah, sure. Sounds good. Because I mean he'll I went off and I was seven and eleven. Sure. Yeah and January Joe. Do you guys remember January Joe when Joe Flacco was good that he was legitimately awesome that playoff. Yeah, that's and and like  Go back to the beginning of the conversation with the defense playing. Well special teams having its moments, especially with Tyler Urban and knowing what's in Aaron Rodgers arm. We haven't seen it as much as we normally have but we have seen it. We know it's still in there somewhere if that happens in the playoffs. Like I don't I think I'd pick up against anybody. I mean, you know, they're not going to be favorite against everybody in the playoffs, but they sure have a lot they have a lot of assets and if that last piece falls into place that big piece of the passing game for three games in January it  It's going to be it's going to be a bit special postseason for the Green Bay Packers. Yep, completely agree. And then next season. I'll write the regression to the mean. Yes article we can deal with it. There's this is the Packers are the 2018 Bears. Yep. That's probably a good comparison. So wow. Well prove me wrong. This is what we said would happen and it did and it's true. Yeah. I mean you can already think about Justice mosquitoes column next year.  What it's going to be on the regression to the mean on the one score games. It's going to be the Packers actually Justice just wrote a piece about Aaron Rodgers is bad because of his receivers. Well, that's true. He is back at his receivers. He had a bunch of stats to support it. So hashtag war on Rogers. Yeah. I've noticed justices in those that happy with been either so good for you just as you're right.  Man, I love Justice great guy. Next question. We got one, right? We got a couple more we can do.  This one's kind of similar.  Yeah, let's not we just we just talked about them outperforming their Pythagorean. We don't need another question on that. So I love Pythagorean because that's a baseball thing too many Scots and asks, Ryan Healey question mark  Yeah, that's a brewer signing that happened like a few hours ago. It was announced a couple hours ago as we record this on Tuesday night. Oh speaking of the Brewers I listened to Matt's clicks. Yes. I told you guys I would I was yeah, I didn't listen the whole thing. I listened the first five minutes look at it. What a crossover star you are as crossing over into another into baseball and also Ryan really is I think kind of bad and I don't know what they're doing. I don't either I'm this offseason is freaking me out. Like I was fine for a while. I was cool with  Thing like oh, yeah, good good good. And now that the volume is up to where it is and it's just up guys that they've signed and I'm waiting for a kind of that one big ticket item to tie it all together and it ain't happened. Then there's not many left like no. I know it items left on the market. So some pictures that I'd still love to see them get but I don't know dude. I'm starting to panic a little. Yeah. This is a weird. I'm not I don't know what the Brewers are doing Ryan Hayley though apparently agreed to terms 15 minutes before his Saturday wedding. Wow married on Saturday and a pin somebody for adulation that oh,  let's do our cons to close things out because archons friend of the show and of show archon. What what role would you prefer Lazard & Kumar Go to be for 2020 just in terms of wide receiver number 2 3 4 Etc 2 and 0. I agree with that. I think I like Lazard a lot. But I think 3 & 0 I would like them to get a better number two that I maybe he can be that guy but I would like I want somebody that I as either a high.  Ceiling higher pick or veteran who I know to be good. So we'll see. I think he would be the de facto number two at like week one, but then maybe by week for he's three. Yeah, if they get a rookie, I agree with that but Sherry Jus T. There's so many good receivers in this class too. But none of them are named Jerry Judy her Judy mean people are considering this like the 2014 draft right? Like this is like the mecca of wide receivers before we get out did anybody so Ryan Ziegler's  is is the Aaron Rodgers eat in the presser the best thing of the LaFleur era and I didn't see it. So I don't know what I'm talking about. I'm incredibly disappointed because I love seeing you eat. I'm a big fan of eat. I eat things all the time. I still think all gasp. No F and break is probably the best thing of the LaFleur era thus far hmm. I don't have any others the latter. The all gas no brake made my made my quotes of the year my top 20 quotes of the year in Wisconsin sports, but  We'll take anything else from Luther specifically did Roger saying carry the G with you, wherever you go is pretty good. Nobody can really credit that to any of the coaches. It's very poetic. It's very poetic. It is clearly something he workshopped. It sounds like something Ryan Braun would say really does huh? Ryan brought in a couple of my quotes of the Year. We're not friends anymore. They're not friends anymore. All right P to the to the 812 very sad Miss 812. It was a scratch kitchen. Yeah.  I wonder if Aaron Rodgers still has a couple rehmat T-shirts though in his closet, but very back. It's about every once in a while. Yeah.  Looks fondly at them. Yes. All right, guys, what do you think Minnesota you next week II don't think the Packers win that game but I've picked against some like a few times here and it hasn't happened. So I feel bad for being a pessimist all the time, but I'm going to pick against him again to okay, it's working. So domestically pessimistic Packers cover Baloo's. Oh, that's not okay. It's not optimistic. They still lose who cares if they come over.  A lot of people care. Did you guys see the the fantasy writers about the Julio Jones touchdown? Nope. So Julio Jones scores the last second touchdown against the 49ers to win right swung a bunch of Fantasy Playoff outcasts won a ton of Fantasy Playoff outcomes. It's like one of the most important fantasy players of all time and these people could give zero shits about the actual outcome of the game. But of course that's fantasy. It's it's weird. It was an incredible play. It was credible game that the end of that game was absolutely.  Bonkers just great players and just terrible reffing all around. Yeah, it had everything it really did. I love terrible reffing. It's the NFL side you it's like yeah, so I just it's a fun lens to look at things. So if you look at things for through the lens of fantasy or through the lens of Vegas wedding, I think it's fun. It is a gloriously selfish way to look at India. We're Monday night this week, right? Yes. Yes. So right so there are there are very few outcomes that matter to the Packers. Obviously they want Seattle.  In San Francisco to lose New Orleans losing has some bearing if like everybody loses out from there, but the Packers would go if they go to in the Vikings lose to the Bears the end of the year that could matter but like probably not need to invest too much into it. There's really only three games. I figure that have anything to do with the strength of Victory tiebreaker. So honestly, there's not much to pull for it's really just to your heart against Seattle and San Francisco and you know for the Packers to beat the Vikings you probably want that too.  That's it. Alright, cool. Slowly break down. Well with that any plugs Jr. Anything, I'm yeah, I'm trying out some other, you know, I mentioned quotes of the year did did the thing of the top 15 no top 25, Wisconsin High School products and their best the best sports years for Wisconsin. I basically in 2019 that story needs a little more love more readers. So so go seek that out you go find that a joke that I have not checked that out yet. I will go read it. I will be putting together. Actually. There's something coming up that  Will credit you for Paul Noonan but a couple more that I got coming moments of the Year athlete of the Year. Overall. Number one will probably be no secret number two will probably be no secret but can just look at the best athletes in Wisconsin Sports. I think I've 19 for 2019 in that category. So that's forthcoming into Us online. Are you including John hack? What is a John hack? What is that? John hack is a Wisconsin native. He was a Badgers wrestler. Okay, greatest 83 kilogram powerlifter of all time.  No idea he I didn't hear that this year. He totaled over 2,000 pounds in sleeves apologies to John hack that that I did not include him on my list. I did get a couple emails one for a couple like a the coach of the central Michigan baseball team led them to the NCAA tournament. And I'm just like, I don't know D3 shout out again. I mean, I don't I I always hate saying this just isn't as visible as just not I hate saying it's not as big a deal because I don't want to say that anybody but like  Is a primarily pro-sports D1 college as kind of as low as goes. So anyway, but what they'll thing that Paul Noonan really inspired is for next week as after the Packers play the Vikings heading into the final week of the season. I did at your 20 year look back at the ending of the 1999 Packer season. Oh season finale more points 99. Yes 99. They had to outscore the Saints think you talked about this on the mini pod, but just the  It did not end up mattering because the Cowboys won later that night and took the took the final playoff spot in the NFC. There were like four eight and eight teams two of them got into the playoffs was a wild year that way just insane and the Packers had to outscore Carolina that came into the day up 18. There were points during the game where they were they were down because Caroline was absolutely thrashing the Saints Mike Ditka goes for to like to kill must ruin the season for the Packers for the Packers and by a non by failing on an onside kick with a game well in hand because he was  All caught up in this thing trying to help the Packers and he ends up almost blowing it Carolina had an almost out of touch time. You see Muhammad almost had the touchdown that would have that would have tilted things but the Packers ended up, you know, getting that tiebreaker. And again, it didn't matter. They didn't go to the playoffs because Dallas one, but it was a crazy scene. It was absolutely thrilling to watch when it happened. So one of the best Packer playoff mrs. Of all time. It's about his kid there can't be a better one there cannot be better. We can't be a better one. So I say yeah that's coming up next week at JS online.com.  That's cool. So I have my shepherd Express column up right now break it down the the very fun destruction of the Bears little bit of film some gifts of haha missing tackles. So go check that out Chariots of Fire. We had to have that and I I barely have actually plugged I was forget but also follow me on Twitter. I am I'm Badger and it in there most of you I know already do but I do, you know a fair amount of writing for my two places, but  If you want to see some of the conversations that we end up having with like with ball the way and Injustice and all the analytics guys. What are the follow just for that reason because we get into it pretty good once in a while. So not that I'm like friends with them, but they at least take the time to respond to me even when I'm wrong always a good time Matt anything good. So this week Wednesday walkthroughs attacking packing company I may or may not actually contribute to it, but I did come up with the concept that we are going to  be comparing a packer to a dog are we? Yes, I was not around this week. So I didn't know that. Okay what John Muir John Muir dink refer said that after I said that they are Alexander was a small ball of anger and Swagger. He said that he was basically a Jack Russell Terrier. I said, he was more like a beagle. It started a long discussion about what Packers are what dogs and we just decided we're going to turn it into an article.  Okay, I did not know that I like it has a potential to be highly adorable. If the pictures of the dogs are good slightly problematic when we're comparing humans to animals. You never really know where that's gonna go careful. Ya gotta take care of their if we literally were to just translate the discussion to an article. It would be great. So I think with someone actually putting in effort and editing it's going to be even better plus editing. I tried to coin the term pet pet and  Do for the defense somebody brought up? I think a good very good point that it's just not a good idea to compare, you know a bunch of humans particularly men of color to being caged animals. So it's like yeah, probably not going to back away from that. I think you're right. And I think I should have thought that through Mathieu and the near the better pet pet and pot if memory serves anyway, well, no I said like someone someone else said heavy petting. Yeah, which I think it was Chris Burke and then I said that there was like a big dime.  Pun in there somewhere because he really likes big time. But like yeah heavy petting Big D. I don't know whatever. So anyway, we're not going to use problematic but we do not have a good product. We do not have a pot good pain problematic or otherwise and we will see if I could tribute to walkthroughs this week because I might just skip that one Paul doesn't like dogs confirmed. I don't like dogs. How do you guys like, I don't even know what breeds look like half the top. Yeah. We saw that dog.  You have there. Yeah, I'm sure he's a good dog. I've like dogs are cool. They're fine. I just don't want one thing. This is Emmy Lou Tammy Lou good to me Lewis is named after Emmylou Harris Yeah country music Superstar. Our chocolate lab is his name is Watson. He's named after Doc Watson. Not a country music Superstar star of 1800 fiction 1990. What do we got after Sir? Arthur Conan Doyle? When did he write his books? Doc Watson was a country singer. Oh, I'm thinking of  of you know, I was thinking the same the actual. Dr. Watson you always thinking of Sherlock Holmes. That's sure are yeah. Also, my in-laws have a very large yellow lab named Hank named after Hank Williams. Also if you want to see some hilarious things search my at on Twitter with the words Hank the world's largest lab a lot of hilarious pictures of Hank and then they also have Patsy named after Patsy Cline. Oh, very good. Right. We have all the greats of country music represented in the form. You should get a dog named.  Be actually Nina growing up had a Dog Named Gus for can't remember probably not the might have been sleeping beauty. Maybe not an experienced Hunter l so, there we go. Yeah cool on that note on that note. I'm happy holidays everybody so late. It's very late. We gotta get out of here. And so let's see next week is Christmas. Yeah. I don't know if we're going to get up here onto Christmas Eve.  Yeah, it's I think that might be a little rough. So we might take a week off due to the holidays, but I'm recorded solo pod depending on availability. Maybe we'll get something a bit of an evil probably won't be a full podcast. So anyway, everybody have a good holiday. It will talk to you next week or two weeks.\",\n",
              "  \"Hey guys, welcome to the Alec and Joe show to share with Alec the Alec and Joe show. What's up guys? Welcome back to the Joe and Alex show the gesture without Joe and Alex show. Well today we're going to be talking about the NFL if you'll hurt the college when we only tune in again, I appreciate it. But today we're going to talk about some real football not playing. But today we're going to talk about the NFL some division predictions some different things going on in the league, you know, and your Luck's retirement Zeke's holdout Dax contract.  T' top five quarterbacks and yeah, just some different sub one day in the future of the New Orleans Saints who are the greatest of all time. Yes, you want to get into the vision rankings project AFC East obviously got the Patriots. I mean that's a horrible division the Patriots have about six by weeks. So meaning the two games that are that are played against the Dolphins the bills in the Jets. Yeah, correct. Yeah. I also have the Patriots there. I don't think any of those teams make the playoffs other the Patriots, you know as a walker. Yeah.  Do well though man. I really like I really really like Jamal, you know, there's you take Gary vaynerchuk one day wants to buy the Jets. I hope he does that would be awesome. I'm so I'm pulling for them to do well, but they're just not good, right? They're not going to football NFC East. I got the Eagles actually whoo-hoo this year have a different world a different quarterback, but you know different new face almost for the u.s. Fans Carson Wentz who is a franchise quarterback, but it's not playing the last couple of years including in their Super Bowl run. Well, correct myself.  If he played in their Super Bowl run but didn't play the playoffs, right? Um, yeah, I think I agree with you there the Eagles win that Division. I want to see the Redskins do well, actually I really don't care if the Redskins do well, I just want to see I want to see these guys do well. Yeah, who's there may not even be their star running back there talking about yeah may not be but Chris Thompson is a hell of a football player. I saw a bit as well though. Absolutely. Um, I think the Cowboys get in as a wild card even though you know Zeke is going to be holding out. I think I think he's going to come down from whatever High he's on and actually  Playing football again, but I guess we'll see you we'll talk about it later on to MSU North which got I think the I think the Browns win this division, but I think the Ravens get in and get a wild-card spot while you know, see I have the opposite actually out of the Ravens one of the division with Mark Ingram back in the backfield. Now, I know the bonds of a lot of talent but it's all young and I understand that that's good because they're talented players. Don't get me wrong, but I don't think I don't think they win the division this year, but for the future, I think they're going to run.  the division for the next  Six years maybe seven years, even if they can keep that talent in Cleveland, maybe win a Super Bowl in the next five years, which is again is bold. I think they start to run that division. Like we were talking about the Patriots doing Baker Mayfield did really really well last year Jarvis Landry is no joke man, Odell Beckham kind of a diva but a hell of a football player. Yeah, I mean super super good. But yeah, I don't I think as long as the more Jackson stays healthy and he's telling how to slide. I think he had actually had a meeting with a Aaron Rodgers after it.  And he was like, did you even learn how to slide? Yeah, if if he continues to take its did you have a very very very short career all the very talented. Yeah. What you got for the NFC North the north man. I think I don't know. Aaron Rodgers is a great quarterback. I hate the Vikings everything about him. I hope they lose every game and I think the Bears come out of that Vision. I think the Bears also come out. I don't know a lot of people actually I read one article that says the best division football game. I mean now that you're tied  Three divisions of football at 8:00. I'm not even putting the NFC South. This is unarguably the best Vision I don't agree, but I also don't think the NFC North is even close because the lines of a lot of new Talent including I don't even remember who they picked up but I picked up a lot of new talent. I don't know. Yeah, I'm sorry. They're going to be talented this year but raw again, like the Browns the Bears defense is unrivaled man. I I can't see the Bears losing that and I don't think anybody makes it in as a walk-on.  Either I can see I can see the packaging as well card. I can see it. Okay, AFC South I think that I think the Jaguars win this one Houston's really good football team. I think we put a damper on their season early. I know then I know the NFL 16-game season long season a lot of time to come back and then one lost isn't really a big deal at all. I'm really excited to see what Jacksonville does I think for net. I know he had a tough year last year. I think he does really well. I think I think the Jaguars come out of I think you forgot the biggest part of the Jaguars. I'm not  Spect in that pic, I disagree, but I think I think the biggest part about the Jaguars their new quarterback. There's yet another Super Bowl MVP quarterback and Nick Foles. Yeah. No, I was going to take that team the new heights but to go from four and twelve to twelve and for something and you know, when they did it they did it, you know, Tina did you that narrow from foreign 12 to 12 for now? Yeah, they did the opposite. You know who actually did the opposite of that is the Texas. It's like you have four and twelve not last year, but the year before in 2018 and 20mm. Sorry in 2017 and 2018. There was hoping for all right.  They learn they want to live in a five. But anyway, I think the Texans actually win this division contingent on the fact that they keep Jadeveon Clowney. Hmm. I'm here new stuff today that Jadeveon Clowney might go to the Dolphins who are actually seems like that's gonna happen to you. It seems like it's pretty promising. They're actually works team in football and a lot of people I mean, they're not good not good at football. Well, I think the Texas when that division contingent on the fact that I'm sorry that different quality stays.  Sighs I think the Colts the close of my favorites if we did this a couple days ago closer went in because obviously Andrew Luck retired if he was still there. I think the clothes were in that Division. I don't even think it's closed because well close being that they beat more of those regular season game. Yeah, they weren't more the red Korean. So obviously that morning the cousin Andrew Luck is tough man, especially just right here week or two before the season 7 episode and neither of us have been mentioning them in the yeah. It's amazing how that doing.  Cobra set is you know, no experience. He's not you know, FCC. Actually, let's go with the AFC West which got the AFC West. Oh, I'm sorry. Do you think any of them make the playoffs as well car? Because there's a through the South. Yeah. I think I think I could I could reasonably spaghetti. I could reasonably see the Jaguars and the Texans both can absolutely okay AFC West but at the same time talking AFC West I could see both the Chargers in the Chiefs getting at exactly and we I think we yeah we already so at this point we're talking through Wild Card teams between  The you think the Ravens the Texans in the Cardinal, I mean, I'm sorry chargers right getting in. So if you're going to keep one of those teams out who's going to be I think you have to kick out one of those teams the Chargers not the Ravens. Well the Texans no, I think it's a Chargers and after loving Gordon's on hold out right now, which is a pretty big deal Chargers. I think the Chiefs win the AFC West look last season. They had the same record as the Chargers but the Chiefs want it Mahomes. It's hard to pick anybody of them homes man. Absolutely. I agree. Yeah.  I don't I don't see them losing. I think Mahomes has another great season. I don't know if you want MVP this season. I think jury might get it. I hope so. I hope so too. But NFC West what you got Rams ROMs run down easily and I don't even think it's a close thing. I don't even think to see how to make the playoffs again enters except for you actually in every year since 1990. So he's talking about a 30-year span. There's 12 teams have been compiled six and six usually our every year since 1990 at least four teams that made the playoffs though your before don't make the playoffs and  - yeah, so you're talking about usually the wall crowd seems the worst. Obviously you're talking about the Chargers the Seahawks the who has made it. I don't remember. But anyway four teams don't make the playoffs that made it last year. I think that's pretty big deal. I think it's going to be Texans for sure a cult for sure now. Yeah at this point I get and the Chargers and the Seahawks I think are my four teams. Okay. The Seahawks don't get in. I don't think Chris cars is gonna so a lot of people don't realize the Seahawks actually led the whole league in rushing last year, huh. You could probably couldn't even tell me.  See, I wouldn't exactly so Chris Carson, you know had a great year. I don't think Russell Wilson is I think he's on the decline which is crazy to me to say and obviously you're going to disagree with me. You know, this is like ass I think around this one and I don't even think it's close. I think calamari is a great year though and wins rookie year, I think okay for the Cardinals the Cardinals. Other than that, I think David's also is great you two, I don't I just don't think the court has have enough Talent. Yeah. There's just not a great football team. They're not going to Football. Let's look at call if calamari can put together put together a really good year than I mean we could be having a different conversation.  In season next year, but absolutely let's get into the messy South NFC South. Would you what you got man? I think the Saints win this one for sure. I think this the Saints win for sure, but she said this is the best Division I do I think it's the best division football but I still think the Saints win convincingly. I think the Falcons could easily get a wild-card bed though. Absolutely. I agree and that's that's what the the cowboys that is. Yeah, and I think the Panthers could be I think the Panthers could make a bit for it to they can make a push for the Panthers Falcons or Falcons and cowboys who you kick.  If you're putting those three in the walk our contention, he's not making it is a Panthers and demand gonna spend it in. Your opinion is the Panthers. I don't mean DAC is not great. He's not good at football. We're gonna talk about that later. Thank you so much. Look at Zeke. If Z can't get it together. Then we may be looking at a playoff with three NFC South teams. You know what I'm actually going to agree with you and I forgot about that Zack Zack and Deke. Yeah, that's not real. They got cancer cells use campus by the way. Yeah.  I don't think they're gonna amount to much without those two. Yeah. Alright, let's get into let's talk about the Saints in depth a little bit more I come how do you feel about the future of the Saints as far as you know, taysom Hill or Bridgewater or how do you feel about their new tight end? I just picked up who is who is actually really really good for the Raiders who haven't had a good football team in a long time, but he still call it. You know, it was at eight touchdowns. I believe and 900 yards with them with their cars at quarterback at Drew.  Is that system? And and now the big thing with the Saints is there is no such thing as double coverage anymore right to guard him. You have to go on camera and you have to guard my God my Thomas. Yeah, so, you know, where's Mike was getting double team last year. It's not gonna be able to happen anymore because can't do as much as I love Benjamin Watson as much. I know you love Benjamin while I've been here Watson. He's not an attention getter. I put a line back on. You know, it's just whereas Jerry Cook runs a 440 actually faster than Mike Tom. He's huge and he's mad I mean this this is going to be big for the Saints. What do you think about just I guess the Saints feature as a whole  I can't talk about taysom Hill in Teddy Bridgewater back. I think man. I know it's tough, but I think I think Bridgewater is a better quarterback. I know you disagree with me there do I think I think take some pills about a football player all around and what I don't want to see which I obviously have taysom Hill becomes the next quarter back to the Saints. I hope he does amazing with it. And you know, the Saints are Mighty my poor form, but I don't what I don't want to see is I don't want to lose taysom Hill at all the other positions that he plays. Yeah, man. I disagree. I think tasting meals a better quarterback and I think that's pretty evident. I don't know if  Watch all the three preseason games for the Saints but I think take some holes are just a better talent. I mean, okay that's on arguable Jezebel's mortality and that sure that's straight up but it's hard to say that he wouldn't be a better quarterback. And I know you talked about like you don't want to lose him at the tight end or the slaughter whatever they're even at running back for some snaps. All right. Well, I mean just a lot of different things for tasting but I think at quarterback you can surely help us out once truly is and I think is I don't know man. I think they just have it on both on the  field would be it would be a really really interesting. I think I'm confident with taste my quarterback. I am I got a house. I'm not saying he wouldn't be a good quarterback to play maker Yammer. In other words. I just don't want to lose another positions. I mean, I think he's I think he has the absolutely absolutely has the potential to be better than the more Jackson even and I put Lamar Jackson. I'm On Top, you know, five six quarterbacks. Yeah. I mean as far as Talent, is there a limit? I mean, he's a running back who can throw the football. Yeah, you know you talk about these quarterbacks dude, he can run. This is a running back who can throw the fuck mean. Yeah, he's running.  People and he had he had better combine stats than Christian McCaffrey. Yeah. I mean dude, he's amazing. He stronger and faster and jump higher in the Christian McCaffrey. That's a really running back in the NFL and this make you throw the football I mean, but I'll say this I'm not wishing Drew Brees way if he'd stayed 20 more years. I would like zactly absolutely probably could probably good. All right, man. Let's get into we're talking about top five quarterbacks. I know you and I disagree on this so number five. Give me your top you want to go first. Give me your top five. Give me number five. I'll give you number five. I think Russell Wilson.  Number five a lot of people would disagree with me on this. Look. I can't really I'm not even going to really explain it not going to try to explain it because I feel like just everybody would what should be down on it here, but he is he's at one of my top five. So I think it's just a really Dynamic playmaker. He's made some bad decisions. He's had a couple he's had a couple rough Seasons, but I think he has top five potential. I should say pretend. I think his potential is filled. I think I don't think there's potential meaning there's there's more for him to go. Hmm. I think um,  I think he's I think he's done. I don't think he's what everybody says. He is, huh? He just got a 65 million dollar signing bonus, right outside of his conscience are signing but I mean, he's not putting up those numbers like that. It might but he's really not my 5 is is between a lot of people I have Roethlisberger. I think after this little model of people. I think it's pretty clear but I 5 have a hard time. I'm between you know, you know, Ben Roethlisberger's out there Philip Rivers up there Lamar Jackson is out there for me, and I know he's young. I know he had  Didn't even start every game last year. So it's hard to say but if you're talking about potential your you're not turn my Russell Wilson, you know, I mean no. Yeah, I'm sorry saying Josh Alan. You're more Jackson Baker Mayfield. That's potential. I mean, they're young, you know another we didn't talk about taysom Hill takes about 29 years old man. Yeah, he's old. He's he was a he went to BYU and then he did he, you know, he's a Mormon he Mormons Mormons and getting that it's not really but you know, but no he went to BYU and he he went and did like a mission thing.  So he's late to the NFL. Yeah, he's 29. He never started, you know, he's late, but no, I don't I don't think Russell Wilson's in my top eight or nine. It's all good he gonna for for I got Tom Brady at for me too. I agree with you on that one time you you said he's number one overall ever. I think he's number two overall ever behind you when you think is number four in the league right now right now right now and a lot of fantasy people will talk about it a lot and a lot of analysts will talk about it. He's not he's doing what he needs to do to win. I mean, so it just needs to go ahead and retires what you're saying.  I mean, it's tough to say that but I think he's definitely decline. I think it's I think it's very do you think everything-everything good like everything great that you're going to talk about. Tom Hardy's career is done. I don't think it was another Super Bowl and here's why I think I think I don't think is enough Talent around them. I mean their defense is amazing. I understand that but I think the Saints win this one and then I think the Rams dude, I think the Rams come in and I think the Rams the next line to see Todd Gurley is Young.  Aaron Donald is the single best player.  In 30 years in my opinion, I mean Aaron Donald is something else. I mean and Jared Goff has a lot of potential. Yeah. He's got a lot of time left and he's not I'm not putting him in my top five right now or top eight or nine, but you made an index for Five Seasons. I understand. He was an MVP Contender is what we gate they are too weak they to and because that was absolutely I'm saying he was he was you know, he was up there man. Hmm. Who's your three Aaron Rodgers?  It's better swimmer than Aaron Rodgers. Aaron Rodgers is a good quarterback. Don't get me wrong. But he's not doing anything with his football team man. He's if you're not many times you been to the NFC championship and this this isn't me being sarcastic because real question. Yeah, I'm going to say twice. I believe he'd been can't get out of it. He can get there anymore. Yeah, I mean was her last year. I understand that for people that are going to be like, oh dude who's her larger? That's why they make the playoffs. I understand that but even when he wasn't hurt, I mean he's putting up decent numbers, but  but he's got a tough five receiver and Davante Adams. I mean Drew has had five receiver and you know talk I mean in Michael Thomas but he's doing something with it. You know what I mean? He's he's doing stuff. He also has a great running back in Aaron Jones and he's he's got a decent one-two-three punch. It's just he's not he's not putting numbers like that. Mmm. Number two. Number one man gets close for me Stuart these yeah, I I'd say right now. I'm actually going to say I am had to do it right now Patrick Mahomes. How dare he is number one. I'm disgusted by you disgust me as a human being  The reasons number one number two for me, and I know I look and everyone else disagrees with me. My home is running BP. I get it. I get it Drew Brees a better quarterback. I wholeheartedly agree with you. And this is this is why I put it at 1/2 as in Mahomes. Then Breeze my home state for 50 touchdowns last. Yeah unheard of unheard of that's ridiculous. That's his first year as well and I just work here but his first year here, what about and and then, you know to couple of means I put that with 5,000 yards, which is only been done. I mean now  now jury says that five times I know he's also in this conversation obviously, but Drew Brees is better quarterback right of all time, but right now so like on a fantasy team or you know, if I need a drive it's it's Drew Brees but Mahomes, I don't know man Mahomes is homes. Put up numbers of Drew Brees will never put up. Yeah. Ruby's has never put up. Yeah. I'm just definitely a better player on Madden, which I'm better than what is in fact that we had. No, I am not gonna argue that now but you're Bruce's team is gonna have a better year this year, I think.  Yeah, I think they're gonna have a better team this year those things like that what you think about Ezekiel Elliott? Hold up.  I think he's an idiot. I think he's dumb. I to be here's my thing with that like right now he's missing camp. Mmm, and I know you've played football. I played football in college even and it's like if you're not with your boys through like the worst stuff that's going on, you know, like the the 12-hour days the ridiculous amount of time that you and he's choosing to be out of that. Yeah, you don't even deserve to play in my opinion. I really like if you're not with him for the worst. Why should be  The for the best right if I'm going to step in we want to be the hey guys, you know, I'm back. I'm not talk to me off its long one of the best offensive lines and you know in football and I'm going to be you know, come back as the running back into the hey guys, like I mean really like obviously I'm gonna do my drum block form, but it's like you can't just step in there. Yeah. It's unexpected. It's particular to be no guys. It's a especially over money. Hmm. You make it 13 million dollars a year and you want to be making 15 really? That's your reason really? There's some people that came to eat and you're from you're married about two million and I can't I can't relate to that.  Lifestyle, man and so I can't really I can't really opine on this because I don't know how much he needs to, you know to retain that lifestyle but man but to me to me, it just seems like a ridiculous over reaction to such a my and it's not a minut amount of money, but but relatively so him right and it's not even that if in my opinion if so Todd Gurley put gets paid 14 million dollars a year, right? Uh-huh. If if Todd Gurley gets paid ten Zeke once 11, you know what I mean? Yeah. He wants to be the highest-paid running.  And I understand that he's he's the best running back in the NFL right now and my opinion as far as numbers goes as far as just a dominant running back. It's either here Alvin Kamara and Then followed by Todd Gurley at second and I understand that he wants to get paid that but he it's a contest for him. I just want to be the highest-paid it's not to do with the fact that he needs 15 million dollars. No one needs 15 million dollars and that whole team is just a disaster because on the other hand you got DAC demand and forty million dollars, how man I don't even  Early don't even want to talk about a doctor before 23 touchdowns last. Yeah, that's horrible. 1.2 per game. Uh-huh. What's happened? Last time you looked at a quarterback stats after a game and you're like, wow, we do one touchdown. He led that team to Victory really did he or is he defending 40 million dollars? Because he's also an idiot. He literally said three seasons the NFL. Yeah, 23 touchdowns 23 touchdowns and 22 touchdowns. And there's 40 million. Yeah, definitely just like Russell Wilson. There's a 65 million dollar signing bonus. And this is a guy that I hate to Hate a lot of people love to hate guys or hate to love guys. I hate to hate this guy. He's  And a guy hated him when he's at Mississippi State wasn't his fault. LSU didn't recruit him. But now he's at the Cowboys which is the least likable team in football in my opinion. Yeah. Absolutely. It's just yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. No, I mean technically they are but I'd rather isn't anybody else right? Um, you know, he doesn't deserve $49 and that's that's just straight up. I don't he's they win. They win games. I'm not gonna say they don't but it's also because they have a fine job linebacker.  And on a 64 million dollar deal. They have Layton vanraj. Who's a rookie last year. Who's absurdly good at football. They've Demarcus Lawrence I'll do if I mean they have an amazing defense Morris Claiborne plays there. Yeah LSU LSU boy. I hope he does great. Absolutely. But we were talking about them being a you know, one of the three teams that could make the wild-card. I think they're I think they are this the first team out. I think Zeke, you know, as of whatever the day they got to get it together man. They got to get it together if they're going to make the playoffs those two have to be back in full swing and it will yeah and you know,  He's always 27 that as of now they're talking Zeke is not even gonna play the first game. Yeah, and and that's that's not okay for a franchise. No, it's not somebody that's America's team. You know, he's been playing for three years. He's been doing amazing for him to say that he don't want to come back to play football with you know, his teammates who has been granted within the summer and doing this it's not. Okay. Yeah and Ford acted be demanding. That's one is more than not. Okay. It's blasphemy. Hmm. So we said we both we both said that the Saints are the best team in football. We both think they're going to the Super Bowl we both think that  They're winning the Superbowl. Who do they be the be the Chiefs? Okay, maybe the Chiefs was game blow out what you got? I Gotta Buy like 14 man. I bought it to possession two possession game. And I think I think the closer game is I think the closer to games actually are the NFC championship in the AFC Championship. You think it's a big separation between the NFC and AFC. If exactly I think the NFC has better better teams man. I know and I'm right. Am I right in saying that you have the same speeding the bear?  The NFC Championship, correct, correct. So you think the Bears you think the Bears would be the sheets and Super Bowl. Ooh good question. Um  I don't and here's why Dave Tirico in at running back which you know, okay and then mr. Biscay.  Not he'll get so the NFC Championship, but he almost did this year because of his defense man that yeah, it's like well Mac and tell you what the Bears are gonna have to make a field goal. If they want to get in get in front of ya coding party sucks. He hit the hit the post four times in one game last year. Yeah, sometimes several to and it again they need to go ahead and make a direct pipeline from Alabama to the Bears. Absolutely. That's what they're looking for in kickers. Absolutely. Yeah, and they're not good. But yeah man, who do you have in the Superbowl? Do you have the Patriots?  No, I have abstinence Chiefs as well. And you have I don't think we win by I don't think the Saints win by two possessions. I think it's going to be incredibly hard to keep homes off the board. It's a high-flying game. It's too high flying offense has been look at the defense has the chiefs were dead last along with the Rams were right there in defense and I think the Saints defense finished the year, like I want to say second in the run and like 28th in the past but like 11th overall or something, right? So, I mean you couple that with the number one offense.  You know one two three offense with those things. I just mentioned like you can have the number. I'd rather the number three offense in 11th defense in the one offense and you know 28 defense, right? So they're deep. I mean, did you watch the Rams Chiefs game last year? It was like 54 to like 52. Yeah. I mean that's not going to happen because it's going to be in my opinion like 54 for I mean like it could be a high-scoring game. You think youth weight and in the Super Bowl you think what you think we're going 50 points in the Super Bowl  We feel jeez. Oh my God naked if we put up 50, that's a real run around. Yeah, not with you. That's weird. But well if it's the Chiefs, yes can visit Patriots know I think we could put a 42 on the chief since we bought absolutely. I don't think that's at it that way. I mean New Orleans would go crazy. And I mean just winning the Super Bowl would do it but mean also know Ramsey would say we're neck and neck right, you know, we beat them in the regular season. They be dissing, you know controversy followed. I don't think they beat us they won or they they got the win absolutely but salty,  The Rams are probably 45 against them or you know, 50 something against them. Yeah, it was 5452. I do believe that was or what and we were just as good as ramps, especially on offense. Yeah. So the Rams offense, right and our offense we put a 50 for you know, just saying they're equal. Yeah. The Rams defense is nowhere near we don't hold them to you know, 21, I could see a 40 like 4221 game. I really could wow if it's achieves if it's the perfect solution for in the Super Bowl if I mean, it's 13-3 this year that's trouble.  It's quadruple in them. Yeah, but you're talking about you're talking about 40 42 to 21. That's a very different scenario 13 buttery. But I think it's horrifying offenses. I lead the Patriots that they're good. I mean that Tom Brady but I don't think I don't know. I think I think we beat the Bears in the NFC Championship. I think the Chiefs be top of that game close not close close various because our our defense is a little bit better than their offense, you know, both, you know, 15 middle of the road our offense and their defense, you know what I mean? It's  Close game. I think I was just getting into watching football. Whenever the Saints lost to the the Bears. I don't know if it was the divisional or the conference the conference game, but it was Devin Hester know which one yeah like yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, but no, I don't I don't think that happened. No, I don't think it happens either. I just know I just have bad and like I just I just associate that with that year. I don't undo not want to meet the Bears in the playoffs. I would love it. I would love it. But you know, I you know, I would love it because we're gonna be the one seed they have to come play us Yeah in our place. Yeah. Good freaking luck. And here's the thing if we have to go.  Them in their place. You have to whether it's whether the whether you know, yeah, right. Yeah, you have to weather the storm is the kind of guy. I mean, it can be snowing by that time, you know, and this I mean do we really want to go in with people from Louisiana and go play in the snow, you know, it's a little different there from the from professional football than it is college boy. Yeah. They got acclimated to New Orleans weather but I mean all these all these players aren't from Louisiana man, but I'd rather play them in a dome. No. Yeah. Yeah for sure and dude our crowd. I mean, yeah in the NFC Championship, I mean this year, especially  Ali like with an enclosed roof like it's loud. Oh, yeah, absolutely and and everybody will tell you that and with a second-year quarterback, mr. Basky who again is not good at football, you know, like right he he's gonna be so rattled dude so rattled, I mean the Rams beat him pretty decently. I don't know. Yeah, let us know Joel. Thank you.

At first. We have an interview and little analysis with Michael David Smith of pro football talk. He's the managing editor there. We talked about the Aaron Rodgers generally speaking if he's overrated or underrated and why Matt Le Flore at some other things and after that, it's just Jer and I mats out with a little bit of a sickness this week, but he'll be back soon. I also wanted to mention we are part of  Milwaukee's tailgate Network patreon and coming up soon.

Fantasy league maybe just tell you something interesting about the Packers match up that way. So now for that anyway, that's it on with the show.  The clocks running time. Hi, everybody it for this episode of reporting is eligible. We have a special guest managing editor pro football. Talk Michael David Smith who I've known kind of off and on for a long time since we go  Lived in Chicago for a while Michael. How you doing? I'm doing great Paul. How are you doing doing fantastic. So first of all, thanks for coming on appreciate it. My pleasure. Thank you for having me. Yeah, and I wanted to have you on partially because I think we're kind of sympatico on a lot of just how we think about football generally but especially on how we think about Aaron Rodgers who seems to just kind of nut skate by but he's reputation is sort of unsullied for almost.  Everybody based on a lot of Seasons that happened a long time ago and since the end of the 2014 season when Jordy Nelson blood his ACL in the preseason, he hasn't really been that player again. He still referred to as often like the most talented the most physically gifted things like that. But what do you think of Aaron Rodgers going forward? And do you think he'll ever get back to that level again? Well, I think the last question  The most important yet. Will he ever get back to that level and I do not think he will and when I see people like my friend Chris Simms calling him still the best quarterback in the NFL right now, I really think Chris and other people who have Rogers that high are really over remembering like a five-year period from 2010 when he won the Super Bowl MVP to 2014 when he won his  is second regular season MVP and are really overlooking what has happened over the last four seasons because you know, he just hasn't been the same quarterback. Some people say well his numbers haven't declined that much and it's true. He's not his numbers. Don't look real bad until you also remember that the passing environment in the NFL has improved. I mean numbers of The League average Quarterback are better last year. He was below the legal.  Average in his completion percentage. He was below the league average in his percentage of passes that went for touchdowns. I just think that when you look at where Rogers has been for the past four seasons, it's really hard for me to say he's ever going to be the same guy. He was in those MVP Seasons. Yeah, and I agree with that. One of my hobbies is just looking up sort of why Aaron Rodgers is good at all and one of the things that really has been a not disturbing but  but he gets a lot of value out of his legs. He actually like he's a little too similar to Mitch true Biscay for my liking where I don't really like qbr is just a but if you look at it like those two last year got most of their value from running and if you just look at their passing were much more middle of the pack or less than that, and that just strikes me as just a terrible way to age into your late 30s if you're a quarterback. Yeah, I would agree with that. I think that  You know Aaron Rodgers, he undeniably has big play ability. And he also undeniably has the great ability to avoid interceptions. And so you would think that well if you can make those highlight reel plays that we still see from Aaron Rodgers, maybe not as many as we saw five years ago, but we still do see and you avoid interceptions as he did last year to an amazing degree.  You would think those two things combined mean you're still a really good quarterback, but then you start to remember how many incompletions he has how many sacks he takes how many plays he doesn't make and I think that's really the key to understanding the way he has declined. You know, it interceptions aren't the only bad plays a quarterback can make incomplete passes are bad plays taking sex or bad plays. We see too many of those negatives.  And they're they're not outweighed by the positives that we do still see but not at the rate that we used to see them right? He's sort of not a flashy bad. It's one of those things where the the analytics people on Twitter really like to focus on those. Throwaways that he has sort of jokingly, but also sort of not so I could just EPA on that the other day that everyone is negative point seven five, which it's not a sack and it's not an interception, but when you lead the league in that by a great amount it adds up over time, so  I agree with I don't think that the Packers should be overly confident in his abilities going forward and once they started paying him like when he was at his best they had Joy Michael Finley. They had Greg Jennings. They had Jordy Nelson. Like Donald Driver was like their fourth receiver and he was still had something to give they probably can't put that team around him again either and I don't know how you deal with that other than you know compensate maybe on defense Maybe by protecting with running like the Saints did a little last year, but  Yeah, and they just don't have the money to do those things in large part because they gave him such a big contract and you were to your credit. One of the few Packers fans who recognized that that contract didn't make a lot of sense given the other option the Packers had which was first tell Aaron Rodgers look, you've got two years left on your contract. We expect you to play out the contract signed and then second say if  Are still playing at that high level? Oh, by the way, we still have the franchise tag to use on you. So Aaron Rodgers really didn't have the leverage to demand the contract. He got and yet the Packers gave it to him anyway, and I think at the time it felt like well, we just have to do it. He's been such a great player, but you don't win Super Bowls by rewarding great players for things they did in the past that  it just isn't the formula for building a good team completely agree. The other thing with him is I do kind of Wonder I converted this to Steve Young the other day. I think it's weird that it every other position baseball like any other position of football. We kind of expect guys to decline starting around age 30 31, except for quarterback where the consensus for most people is focused more on the you know, Brady's in Favre's of the  Old but that's not really the norm. We just happen to see these couple guys who are super outstanding who do manage to last forever, but it's really unusual for that to happen more than it is usual. Yes. That's right, you know, you can play the position at a high level past 40 we do see Tom Brady has done it, but you also can be all that 35 at the position just as you can.  In virtually everything athletic. I mean there there are very few things. We're a professional athlete is just guaranteed to just be fine into his late 30s, you know, and I think we focus on outliers at quarterback certainly like Tom Brady and to a lesser extent Drew Brees right now, but we kind of when we focus on outliers. We're missing the large.  Back of quarterbacks who actually start to decline in their early 30s and by their late 30s have retired.  Yep, exactly. And I think he fits the mold for that more than he does the Brady Breeze. He's always back there buying time get taking hits using that Mobility. I mean Brady gets the ball out fast. He's great at it freeze to a lesser extent but still gets the ball out fast. He strikes me as a guy with a pedigree that's not going to age. Well, so that's part of part of why I didn't think they should necessarily leap into that extension, but is what it is could be worse, but a couple of years from now, I wonder how they're going to look back on this.  Yeah, I think that's if we're looking ahead to the 2022 the summer of 2022 and we're talking three years from today. I think it's pretty unlikely that we're going to be sitting there saying boy, it sure was smart of the Packers to extend Aaron Rodgers give him that huge contract, you know, because he's still playing at an MVP level and he's worth every penny. I think it's quite unlikely that that's  We'll be saying at that point. Yeah, indeed. All right, so I also wanted to talk to you about the new Packard coach. It was Matt LaFleur came over from the Titans a lot of Packer media. A lot of my friends included seem to have a great amount of confidence that a he'll be better than Mike McCarthy and be that they have some idea about what kind of offense he's going to run. I am. I'm kind of a skeptic on both the floor and Mike Patton frankly, but with a flirt like you are more incidents like National League.  Covering football than I am for sure for sure. Do you have any opinion on how he's going to be? Well, if if you had asked me a year ago or even like November of last season to name some of the assistants who I thought were going to become head coaches. I don't think I would have named the floor. I didn't see him as that kind of the hot assistant coach that the teams are really looking for. He's running the offense that  Every team wants that he wasn't one of the guys I would have put on that list. I think one of the things you and I have discussed in the past is he was actually allowed to leave for a lateral move to go to the Titan. Yep, which which always makes me scratch my head a little bit how how great was he has an assistant if if the team that had him under contract was willing to just let him walk.  I didn't necessarily think he did a great job as an offensive coordinator last year, so I didn't really look at him and think well, this is a guy who is definitely going to be a head coach on the other hand. I also think it's fair to say that it's just really hard to predict which assistant will be good head coaches. There are their assistants who at the time they're hiring people are saying but he doesn't really have the credentials to be a head coach and then he's a  Head coach. There are also long time coordinators who are among the most respected assistant coaches in the NFL who just don't make it work as a head coach so very tough to say so although I wouldn't have listed him as one of my top head coaching candidates a year ago. That doesn't mean he was a bad hire just means he's more of a kind of an out of left field there. Yep. I think that's fair. Like that's kind of felt that way about Frank Reich when he left the Eagles for the Colts. Talk to you a lot of  My Philadelphia friends about who gets credit for that and it was all Doug Peterson but Frank Reich appears to be very very good and maybe yeah and Frank Reich by the way was not even one of the Colts candidates, right? That's real II forgot about any spurned them. So, you know, even even the Colts hadn't identified Frank Reich as a top candidate until they were left in a very bad situation when Josh McDaniels burned them and now  I think Frank Reich has done a better job so far. Anyway than I would have expected Josh McDaniels to do so, you just don't know. It's just really really hard to tell which assistants are going to be good head coaches. Yep, but I totally agree with that. We're hopeful but there's really not much to go on I'd say my biggest fear with LaFleur is McCarthy's play-calling got stale. There's no doubt about that. But I did like the run past mix that they went. I like that they leaned pass heavy. I just think it's place where  Get creative and it's passing offense didn't work and I'm worried that the flow is going to come in here and just upset that a little bit maybe run just slightly higher quality plays but do some of the things I don't like with the running game, but at least the Packers have a good one so it could be worse also again, so I know you're a Michigan guy know you're a bit of a lions fan. What do you think about that Patricia so far?  In his first year, I was not really impressed. I think he although he doesn't call the offensive plays. He's a defensive coach. He I think is one of these coaches who also kind of has this like run the ball mentality real teams run the ball. That's what tough football is all about, and I actually thought that last year.  Particular we were seeing things like the extent to which he really wanted LeGarrette Blount involved in the offense, even though it was clear LeGarrette Blount just had nothing. I mean, he just didn't have anything left and it was really difficult to see the Lions focusing on LeGarrette Blount as a centerpiece of their offense when you could just see it wasn't going to work eventually carry on Johnson supplanted him and Karen Johnson.  I was a better running bag. I still think in the in the long term. It doesn't really make a lot of sense that they've invested so much in Matthew Stafford and then they turn around and say well our identity is going to be a run football team. But but you know, they did at least improve when carry on Johnson was the runner instead of LeGarrette Blount that also made me question though why it took so long for the Lions to realize the carry-on Johnson was the better of there, too.  Running back. So that's always something that I always I always feel like when it looks to everyone on the outside like the guy who's starting isn't as good as the backup and then eventually the backup proves that I always wonder well, why didn't the coaching staff realize it win like every fan. I know it was already saying it. So yeah agreed bad self scouting is always a good tell for a team. I do kind of feel bad for Matthew Stafford just his gifts just seemed to be just whipping the ball down the field and he hasn't really been  In an offense that lets him do that for quite a while now since Jim Bob Cooter took over probably. Yeah, and it's such an important part of that the quarterback and Coach mix is so important. You have to have a coach who runs an offense that gets the most out of what the quarterback does. I mean the classic example that everyone kind of makes fun of is Jeff Fisher's offenses. Just you just could not evaluate a quarterback in  at office you just what you know Jared Goff goes from Jeff Fisher to Sean McVeigh and it's just such an obvious night and day difference and I think that you're right that Matthew Stafford has also been one of those quarterbacks where he becomes kind of hard to evaluate because you don't see the team asking him to do what he does best and it would be interesting to see what would happen if  If the the offense was asking him to do what he does Best But I don't know that Darrell Bevell, the current offensive coordinator is going to run that kind of offense either. So yep difficult to tell what you have in Stafford when you pay a lot for his big arm, and then you're not letting him use it. Yes indeed and just to sort of round off the north Mike Summers boring so skip him but so I think we both like Matt Nagy quite a bit. But I the one thing I'm the Bears that I kind of wonder about is  How the defense is going to function after last year just because I do think it's a step down from Vic fangio to Ghana or just I like Fonzie a lot actually wanted to kind of be the Packer coach just to up the defense there didn't happen obviously and then I do feel like their personnel has gotten worse than they sort of realized and what Packer fans will identify hakan dicks, but like losing Callahan for Buster's grind that seems like a pretty significant downgrade as well. So I'm sure they'll be good but  I do wonder if they'll take a little bit of a step back maybe a little bit better offensive lie, but I wonder about that defense regressing maybe a little more than people think. Yeah, and of course the defense was so good last year that it really can't help but get good stuff back. But but I think that losing Vic fangio may have been the biggest loss of any assistant coach in the league. I think he might have been the most important assistant who changed  ABS in the NFL this offseason. So I think that's a pretty big loss matinee. He was my choice for coach of the year. I thought he did a phenomenal job. I bought his offense. He really I thought he inherited and offense that wasn't very talented and really made the most of the talent. He did have I think he made Mitch true Biscay look better than he really is definitely like if you guess so how true  ski, like kind of is on the eye test and then look at his numbers from last year versus when he had Fox like that Improvement was very substantial and I still don't think he's that good but they got a lot out of that guy. Yeah, they really did. I mean matinee he you can see he can really coach offense and it wouldn't surprise me if in his second year the offense it actually looks pretty good. But I also think the defense likely takes a step back fangio, I think.  Certainly losing him hurts. I would also just say that I would bet you that Khalil. Mac will not have as many big splashy plays as he had last year, you know, not not to say to Camille. Mac will not be a very good football player. But last year it kind of felt like every time they are opposing offense did something wrong. He was like right there right place right time credit to him, but that tends not to repeat itself.  Elf individual defensive stats can kind of rise up and down depending on some things that are not always within that individual defensive players control and I would bet Khalil Mac won't have as splashy as season as he did last year. Yeah. I think they had so many things go right for them on defense. Not that they're not an outstanding defense, but just turn over wise Flash plays so many big plays that defense is tend not to to have happen to two years in a row.  I'm sure that the Bears will still be very good. But I do kind of think they might be a little more vulnerable anyway, so both of us are I would say if fans at least knowledgeable about football Advanced statistics analytics and they've taken at a pretty big step forward over the last like year year and a half. I see more guys on Twitter getting some notoriety like been Baldwin who now writes for the athletic from field goals Josh are inspired by pronouncing his name wrong.  But so I went through this when like focusing on baseball long time ago and I think when baseball had its analytics Revolution that a lot of first law think fire Joe Morgan is responsible for this and Ken tremendous and make sure but people have a tendency to talk down to people and not really sell their message very well and I see that happening on football now too. I think people are really over confident with a lot of what they believe about analytics telling us about football. Do you kind of see the same thing with with those guys?  And to expand on what you're saying about player Joe Morgan can tremendous Mike sure to be clear. Mike sure is a brilliant writer of Comedy. Absolutely so he can do that in a funny way, but I think when other people try to adapt his mocking tone, they're not as funny and it comes across meaner. Yep, and it should and I think that that that is a problem.  Mm that we do sometimes see in football analytics that you know it no NFL head coach is a doofus who knows nothing about football. Right? I mean, they they all certainly know a lot about football know some of them would be better coaches if they would be more open-minded about what analytics has demonstrated and it's absolutely valid to criticize them for those shortcomings, but I do think  I think that there can be a tone of mockery that takes it too far. And that really is it is counterproductive to the ideas that we want to be spreading to come across like you always are mocking people rather than trying to educate people right and just to push that a little further in baseball analytics a lot of what they thought originally when  They started kind of doing it at a high level ended up being wrong, like things like ignoring defense. They just didn't have enough information when they first started it like a lot of money ball is about the fact that you can ignore defense for offense and that turned out to not be true and my suspicion is that there is a lot there are a lot of people right now making a lot of bold pronouncements about the proper way to play football that are going to end up with that throwing back in their face at some point like coaches who who sell the running game who like to have a strong running game.  Wager that they know more than people think they do about the effects of that. If you talk to any like former lineman, like they'll all tell you up and down like we love firing off the ball. It's good for morale. It's good for it is good for something. So just because EPA doesn't like it does not make it so automatically I would say yeah and you know, I think we might find that unsurprisingly Bill Belichick is like way ahead of  of what a lot of people think and because we've seen the Patriots, you know, they'll win games passing 50 times. They'll win rate games running 50 times and I think that we may find that the real answer is on average passing is more effective than running but there are reasons when running is more effective than passing and that, you know, maybe Bill Belichick and  The atoms in their secret lair have figured this out and they're just not putting it on Twitter. So the rest of us aren't privy to everything that they've discovered right? I think that's probably true. I think everybody knows like it's certainly possible to pass too much that that is definitely the case. So the level maybe hasn't been reached yet where people are passing too much in some instances. But I mean that has to be matchup depended hugely. It has to  I have a huge like Personnel impact is to whether you're good at it or not. I know that last year on the Packers Rodgers had a very down Year Aaron Jones yards per carry was about the same as his yards per attempt like that's getting close to the level running does become more efficient. It has to be especially against certain certain opponents. So yeah, and you know generally speaking running, you know it in generalities it or at least what what coaches would  You is running is safer. In terms of turnovers running is more likely to turn out first downs, you know, there are reasons to do it and situations to do but and so you do have to be careful about overstating the the uselessness of running and I would also just say that when I do think running backs are pretty  Her changeable, that's not the same thing as saying running offenses are interchangeable. You know that there are other players involved in the running off and and their influence may be quite important to helping a team room. Yep. I would agree with that. So just all those analytics people tone it down a bit. I'll try and teach a little bit more and otherwise you never know what's going to happen like that gets better and people learn more things and coaches are not just  Mommy's. All right. I think we can probably wrap up you have anything that you want to plug mention that you're working on?  No, just I'll just say that you know, Paul you're one of the best in the business. I love the stuff you do covering the Packers. So I'm going to plug you and everybody should be reading everything you write about the Packers because I know I do that's very kind of you. Thank you very much, Michael. All right, that's Michael David Smith managing editor for both football talk. Thank you very very much for joining me. Thanks for having me Paul.  Everybody it is episode 3 of reporting is eligible. We are a little bit of an odd show tonight. We have a short short bench. It is just Jr. Myself. Matt is office six somewhere. And so we're going to do this a little bit brief. We're going to have an interview with Michael David Smith of pro football talk stitched in here, but we are going  So I care about first is the preseason game that happened on Thursday. And it was kind of a painful preseason game is get the Baltimore Ravens a pretty good franchise very run focused and Jer. I don't know about you but it was what it was like the epitome of the unwatchable Leti of preseason. It was very bad. And you know, there was that stat that I had not heard before that was hiding in plain sight about them winning. What was it 15 consecutive preseason games or something of that nature?  And that actually when I heard that I thought that's a little bit of a red flag. Like do they take they just take these kind of seriously and we already know that Baltimore is kind of got a nasty streak in them, you know on defense that least they have over the years and so it honestly didn't wasn't not necessarily just because that's that but not having Aaron Rodgers play. It's not that bad. Right like it's alarming that he may not actually get a chance to implement some of the new things with Coach mellow, you know that coach mental first implementing, but I was actually fine.  That you know what the less preseason the better. All I do is sweat out those series anyway with Aaron Rodgers in there. So it's probably for the best. Yeah. I think it's fine that he doesn't play he probably needs some time but maybe not against that team like he does need to go through live action at some point. Maybe joint practices are good enough for that. I don't know but like brand new offense. I I feel like he always starts at last year. Obviously, he didn't he did kind of start Rusty last year against the Bears actually before he got hurt and that's kind of its own thing as to why that turned around but  I'm not going to say he doesn't take enough preseason reps, but I don't know. It's a little concerning to see him take zero. I kind of miss the days when starters what at least play the first series of everyone. It was kind of nice just to see  Yeah, and there's some I think Peter burtowski made this point. It's not it's not a bad one that what's the point of playing two series he gets in there. I mean, do you really clean anything from that? Does he really learn anything from that is the game action that much more valuable in a preseason game that whatever however many plays he plays there, you know 12 plays or even worth it to risk the injury in that window. Maybe maybe he's right. I don't really know. I think this is an imperfect formula. It's getting tweaked. It seems anecdotally we've seen star.  Less and less over the past five years as teams become more mindful of these injuries. And I mean even in that first game with Oren Burks going down like even as limited as they were virtually nobody no starters. They still managed to lose a starter. So so I guess it's just it's a tough. There's a no it's a no win situation if they if they stink out of the gate everyone's going to blame the fact that they didn't play enough in the preseason and if they play and they get hurt that's a problem. So there's honestly no way to there's no good way to handle this. It just got to survive for weeks of football of of  quote unquote football. Yeah, I suppose that's true it I do think it's a little bit of a problem for the NFL not I mean not that they can't sell any product that they put out there but like they really are harder. That's it depends where it's located. That's making sell it in Winnipeg. That's actually a good point. Like apparently what this game is like half sold out at this point and it is interesting to see how they struggle to sell tickets when they're not bundled into the season ticket package and they make people buy them and go to them.  This one's not full. And you know, it's in Canada. It's not really a destination. If you're in Green Bay already nothing against Canada. I love Canada, but Green Bay natives are not like running across the border to travel to Canada to watch preseason football game. So you're really relying on the selling of the NFL itself. When you do that destination game, it's a weird one. Like I would like to actually have been a fly on the wall of how it got there in the first place. I have to think the NFL is soon because the Packers are essentially gold.  When it comes to traveling fan bases and I mean it is it is in the north. It's sort of like if you project the the border of North Dakota and Minnesota due north you could get there in like 10 12 hours depending on where you are in the state of Wisconsin. So I'm guessing they thought that the Packers would bring in some people that way and that people in Canada would just be fascinated to see if it's like Canada is starved for American football, you know, they've had they've had the CFL this isn't like this. It's not like going over to England where you don't have  The other any other American football they actually have a better Sunday ticket package. Then we do down here to like it's I think available on not basic cable, but like it's not, you know tied in with DirecTV like it is here. You can actually get it pretty regularly without much money so they can see way more actually NFL football then we can too. So that is very weird. Go to Canada. You should go to Canada to watch their Sunday ticket instead. That's a really good suggestion how many Packers fans are going?  Going north just to watch the game on Sunday take our and Manitoba probably get them out. That actually sounds pretty fun. That sounds. Yeah, so okay wise I mean it was pretty awful a lot of people who played well last week were bad this week Ty Summers Chief among them who we talked about missed like 15 tackles. Like did anybody like Curtis Bolton he played well, you might be a starter. He's  Under sized inside linebacker, which is the only kind that we like on the team and he was everywhere and a tackling machine. I just wonder if he plays against first strangers how he'll look but there weren't really any other Packers that really acquitted themselves where well Darrius shepherd He was going on special teams, but defense kind of got pushed around quarterbacks look bad back up. Allen Lazard was okay Titans did not too much cornerbacks man who brutal and then nobody could tackle anybody on Baltimore which is kind of  at the Moores Mo but I don't know. It's analyzing a preseason game. It doesn't matter. Anyway, at least the kicker's look good. There's no yeah. I made that that matchup between Mason Crosby and Sam ficken is kind of kind of becoming Mason Crosby's as I guess. I would have expected. I'm sure a lot of people have expected. You know, Allen Lazard is getting a little bit of love from from the quarterback at least during the midweek sort of interview sessions. So that's that's very promising and  You know, that's still going to be an interesting. There's still a couple really interesting position battles. I'm not sure the preseason game put us closer or further away from understanding that but I am curious who what you thought of rochon Gary because they're this has been a very interesting narrative with him. We've gone from the guy being drafted and nobody understanding that and then I think slowly we've all talked ourselves into the possibility that he actually is a great fit for my pet and system and he's got these Rod gifts and he might actually be a Difference Maker and then  it's sort of like well, maybe he's it'll be difference-maker down the road like next year and now the little bit we've seen him has been pretty spectacularly bad, but I don't I still don't know where we're at it like are we planning on him for 2019 or is he more of a 2020 project at this point II don't know like I'm a little kid. I believe it makes me a little nervous. I don't know what you think about him. I first I didn't like that pick in the first place because I have it. I have a two-step scouting process that I use which is are you at the at least a minimum athletic capabilities?  For playing the NFL and then are you good at football and at Michigan he really really struggled now. I know some guys will tell you on tape. He did a lot of Dirty Work in the trenches to free up other guys, but somebody is athletic as rochon Gary should have been able to like win one-on-one occasionally in passing situations, which Michigan opponents had a lot because they were buried a lot and he didn't do it. He really didn't put up and he's been really really drawn camp like sometimes those guys develop but  It's it's a kind of the rare case that you develop a advanced pass rush repertoire too late after you were drafted. So I'm worried. I'm worried about him now and especially since a lot of what you heard about and was that chase wake of which is that his name was the beneficiary of Gary in College Pro Football Focus has graded him much much higher. A lot of other places have to his like cases having a really good priest is looking really really good. And I think it calls into question, you know, just how true.  That narrative was it Michigan. So like it he went by the way, he went way later in the draft. So nobody doubts carry super talented, but this that effort and again, I meaningless preseason game was very reminiscent of his Michigan efforts that got him criticized and that had him falling, you know, some what's down the draft board. I mean a lot of times a guy like Gary would go in the top five. He's as athletic as guys who have gone that high like like the clown he's of the world and things like that, but  This is what you get when you draft him and you've got to motivate them and develop them yourself. I am skeptical that you can actually do that. So I actually wrote about a little bit this week in the shepherd Express back in when the Jets were just after 2010 season when they almost made the Super Bowl and up drafting Muhammad Wilkerson to add to the d-line and he's defensive tackle not an end. But a lot of what was said about Wilkerson and college was said about Gary and college to that. He was one of the best athletes  The class that he would go much higher but just wasn't there on every play and they actually did get the most out of him at least for a couple of years, but it popped up again Wilkerson, you know ended up on the Packers for a reason part of that was it reared its ugly head again that he just couldn't keep it up all the time. So, I'm not a big Gary fan. I hope that doesn't come back to bite him.  So you think Curtis Bolton could be a starter, huh? Why don't you tell me what makes you say that? All right. Well for starters for starters Oren Burks isn't going to be a starter. First of all, let's let's qualify starter at inside linebacker with the fact that there's not going to be a lot of them on the field at any given time. That's a going to be a sub package rotation for a lot of you know, there's going to be a lot of nickel and a lot of time but in Blake Martinez is obviously the entrenched starter there, but he's a  Good throughout the preseason. He's like good in both games. Not as good in game one is game too, but he's very very athletic and he is kind of what they look for in that sort of hybrid inside linebacker. He's kind of like what they wanted Josh Jones to be and he's actually about the same size as him not that he can drop back in play safety, but he's pretty good in pass coverage for linebacker. So he's he is teeny tiny he so if you look at his relative Athletic score, he writes very highly on.  Except height and weight where he's like in the 10th percentage of inside linebackers. And so I mean the question with him. Is it really can he move? Can you play it's just kidding. Will you get overpowered especially if there's not blocking in front of him? But on the Packers their kind of is blocking in front of them, that's one of the places that they Excel on defense. That's where Kenny Clarke and you know, some some big defensive lineman live and keep guys off of him. So he's been consistently impressive. He's benched. I think he's been practicing with them the ones for a while now, so  That too I would bet on him to definitely make the team and you know on their starting some package with two inside linebackers. I bet he'll be there in week one.  So I guess then if we move it out from the game, we got to sift into the the TMZ of it all with Aaron Rodgers and Matt LaFleur maybe disagreeing about whether or not he needs preseason reps at all in these preseason games. I know we just kind of touched on that but do alarm Bells go off for you and you see that they maybe have different interpretations of what is needed. What is expected if he's going to play in this Winnipeg game if he's going to play at all. I don't know what to make of it, man. I keep thinking I can dismiss it for so long.  Long and I've really haven't paid very close attention to their to their Dynamic I guess. Yeah, I suspect there are on the same page about this and I know there's probably some veteran privilege occurring with with Rogers. I wish his so let's assume for the sake of this conversation that Aaron Rodgers is basically fine that he would definitely play in a regular season game that he would play in most preseason games if you know in 10 years ago, but  That was a weird noise. Yeah. Sorry about that. I'm not exactly sure what that was to be honest. My phone started started talking to me. Yeah, I'm used to the normal ones. But anyway, um, I wish you would have picked something besides a fake bad back if he's healthy just because it isn't old man injury and it makes you think like there's like a 20 percent chance that it's legit like and bad backs. Are there terrible like, you know as they say no one ever.  Had a bad back like once you have a bad back you have one forever now. He's probably fine and it's like I don't look later cares if he plays into many preseason games. I doubt I'm sure Rogers doesn't want to play into many preseason games, even though he'll never say that publicly. So I don't I doubt there's much of a you know, a rift along those lines and Veterans just do this. I'll at least he's not like freaking out about his helmet could be way worse. Oh, yeah, that is true. He was among those who had to change their helmet and  he handled it a little differently than a certain Oakland Raiders receiver. I have got to go back and watch Hard Knocks. I have not. I have not caught up with that show this year and I have got to go see it. They're doing a good job with commercials for right now, aren't they? They sure are. Yeah, it seems to work out that way. There aren't many years where there's in some sort of drama that the plays into the to the HBO show so kudos to the NFL they find a way to ingrain the drama in there. They are the best. They're the best at marketing.  But anyway, I like it. It's fine if he doesn't play and I would like to see him out there because I do think he needs reps, but hopefully it's not hurt like it. He keeps saying like he's like kind of missing practice and saying like, oh it's acted like acting up on me if he's actually hurt. Then this becomes a big deal very quickly like yeah, that's terrible, but it probably isn't so it's worth it's worth watching like backs are no good.  I don't know. It's true. Hey, let's talk about the offensive line. We don't talk enough about it. And I love I love the big function. Yeah, but Sublime because the Packers offensive line is great. It is good, right and and fascinatingly, you know, I don't think a lot about offensive guards. I'm guessing most people don't but you know, you take them for granted you just assume Lane Taylor is going to be a starter and now you learn that he's in a little bit of a battle with Alton Jenkins and I don't know. I know we had a I know we had one of our questions this week was about  Offensive line personnel and you know, it's kind of starting to feel like maybe they kind of they have they have some debt. They have some options. It's kind of a it's kind of nice that to me. I've always I always view them as super important because keeping the quarterback healthy is the only thing ultimately that I really care about on a week-to-week basis. So it's nice that the guys up front are going to be are going to be capable of doing that. Yeah, and honestly, Aaron Rodgers does those guys Dirty by scrambling around and taking much more many more sex than right. He really should actually that's why I think there would be  Some value in some preseason snaps, even if it's just too serious just for those guys to get used to that Rhythm and because it's been talked about how how the guys like bakhtiar in bulaga and the guys have been there a long time. They start to really get a sense for Aaron Rodgers movements. That's a that's a big deal for those guys. It is and keeping him upright. So their first of all, it's great that Elton Jenkins is kind of pushing Lynn Taylor because land Taylor is a if he ends up getting pushed up back up. He's a good backup to have he's super  Earth style and it's already shown himself to be you can play a passable tackle, but he's good from God to garden and Center. So if he ends up there that's a good problem to have and they have had an elite Run game when they run for three years in a row those guys can Maul and bakhtiari is the best left tackle and football now, so like they're really unsung heroes Rogers almost always is closely league in sacks it by the way sex is basically quarterbacks that we have good data on this now quarterbacks really do run themselves into more sacks.  You got every once in a while, they would get blown up the middle last year at guard where they were rotating in Byron Bell and whoever else was in that position. But for the most part they keep him really clean and he just gets himself in trouble. So they've looked by they've been pretty good in pre-season to across the board as a unit even like the backups who were bad last year have performed pretty well. Like well not just in Spring not well, is he still there? Yeah, okay.  I was like, I thought I thought he was gone. He thank goodness. He was just awful. That was tough. That's tough top draft pick. Not not a great outcome there. Yeah, so he was just just he was sort of the Curtis bolt and of tackles. He was his Ras was extremely excellent except for his size, which was very very very very very small and you could really tell on that guy boy, did he get pushed around but the lion the lion looks like a real  Unit strength Ellen Jenkins looks like he's gonna fit right in and I think probably start and they will just have good depth, which is excellent, especially if they plan to run a lot more this year, which is the stated plan of Matt LaFleur. So that part is in good hands still a little worried about receivers, but offensive line that the Packers have like always been good at developing it for the last like 25 years. They've always been pretty good. It's great. Yeah.  I get guys with low draft picks and going back to like Mike wall Marco Rivera marked how sure they find them out of thin air man? And you know David bakhtiari was at was a second-team all-conference guy in the Pac-12. You would have never thought of him as oh that guy is going to be the best defense, you know, the offense of the best left tackle in football. You would have never thought that but they've whatever work somehow that works. They can't maybe get you know, some some of the other areas on defense may be a little more challenging but the offensive line they figured it out and that's with  The draft of Derek Sherrod which didn't work out because of injury in 2011. Yeah, that was unfortunate. They really do drafting develop. Well, they're Porter. That's Eric's red pig. I probably should have worked. Oh, well, they I feel like yeah, they used to kind of be like this with receivers to or they could always find them anywhere and that kind of started to go away. I think a lot of the rest of the league kind of caught up with what makes a good receiver but not so much offensive line that the Packers really do still seem to enjoy an advantage there and still manage to kick out passable guys with regularity.  Which is good because they're expensive to buy two. You don't want to have to go into free agency to get offensive. Linemen. They tend to be beat up. Like that's one where you go downhill pretty quickly and expensive. So, yeah, it's a good strength of the team. It's a good thing that they can build on that if their class project as far as receiver. I feel like Jim on more he's doing we've talked about being infringed. Yeah, we talked about it being a french guy. Anyway, this car accident he was in terrible as it was, you know, he was cited for it's already putting about he's already a little behind the eight ball.  Jury, he was not going to make the team before that happened. Now. He's definitely not going to make the tea. Yeah, and I am curious with Jay Stern Burger coming back how he fits into the whole thing. And that's you know, I think the tight end group is kind of interesting and there's some injuries there to Jimmy Graham a little bit. But I I really don't know what to make of what they have with their tight ends right now. Yeah, that's one where I could see there being some surprises. I think marcedes Lewis may end up being kind of the odd man out a little bit even though I think he's kind of a good fit for what they want to do.  But tonya's been been quietly. Excellent. I cannot that quietly said some some moments, but ya know people know that guy's name by now big time. He's I think he'll be a fan. He's not a fan favorite already. He will be shortly. But like I say, I think Jimmy Graham's kind of washed up. I thinked onions probably better than he is at this point and one of those young players. I wouldn't I would not be surprised to see starting Sternberg still in the concussion protocol kind of a kind of a  You'd pick and hasn't had a really a big chance to shine or do much of anything in Camp yet so high enough traffic that I'm sure he's not in danger, but not he's a weird one. Like he's not a super great fit not as super great athlete not really that much of a blocker kind of like should be grabbing that way, but I think he might be kind of a develop year before he really makes an impact. I don't see him doing much this year, especially with how I don't have deeps the right word. Like I'm bizarre on the tight ends, I think.  Tanya is way better than everybody else's I think Graham is washed up, but we'll get too many targets. I kind of like Louis for what he can do in run past variety and I don't like Stern burger burger and that's probably completely different from how the Packers be that position. So, I don't know what they're gonna do. Yeah, if they have listened to the gospel of Paul that would have drafted a guy like rochon Gary or J Sternberg on the first place is almost certainly true. I actually tightens tend to be kind of overvalued in the draft. So I would wait till later to pick any of them, but  He part, you know part of the promise. He just appears to me to be worse than the ones who went to directly ahead of him by quite a bit. And if you were going to take a tight end, I would have rather you taken Hawkinson or I forget who the other Goodwin was, but that's where I would have. I mean, I don't like using the capital at all. But if I'm gonna do it, I would prefer to get a better one than what he appeared to be but Tanya needs so  yeah Robertson and he's the he's he's on your list breakout stars of 2019 Roberts onion before we get to those questions. Let's see if there are any I don't actually know if there are but wanted to mix in a little bit of a plug and and some good debates and something that I know is near and dear to your heart and that is list making the we didn't get a chance to talk about this last week when the Journal Sentinel the the company for which whom with with whom I am employed. They they put out a list.  I had nothing to do with this but a list of the 100 greatest Green Bay Packers of all time. This is the 100th anniversary season of the Green Bay Packers. They have they have played a hundred seasons and all right. Yeah. Yeah. Well I so they said about because they wanted to make it purely on ability, which is a tough. Obviously a tough sell in any context but when you're talking about people from the 20s, I don't know how you compare them to the people of the 90s, but we're Beyond but whatever and famously at this point had Bart Starr  Are ranked number 11 overall and some names that like Vern lewallen. I'm not sure people will even know that name is very good. But like number five or in the wellin and then you've got a guy likes Target and the the argument being that STARS Physical gifts weren't necessarily what made him such a such an iconic part of the franchise and he wasn't necessarily a passing quarterback most of the time. So I guess that's how you defend it but, you know five championships and seven years kinda I don't know like their death  We people even in the building that are kind of puzzled by that. I am definitely puzzled by that. I think you put Bart Starr in the top five without it. You know, like that's that's you're like off the top of your head start of the list, but I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. What do you think you look at this stuff a little bit. What do you think about that? So part of the thing with the old players is if you're going to if you're going to have players from from the olden days ranked as highly as they did on that list. I think you have to have star higher and he is he is underrated for his passing ability.  So I think is he was a humble guy who would tell you to your face? If you asked him that he wasn't a very good passer, but that's not true. This is you you cannot read this anymore because the website locked itself up but there's a website called cold hard football facts back in the day and they did a really good statistical breakdown of how star how good star was in his era and he was like absolutely outstanding especially in playoff time. He was a great and accurate passer he and in an era when there wasn't  Each passing. He actually threw a good amount more than you might think. He's got a bunch of iconic passes. I mean Max McGee was didn't catch two touchdowns drunk in a Super Bowl because there was a bomb throwing in the ball. Yeah. He did reach back to get that one star pass but a lot of the rest of that was just dead on so start isn't just one of the greatest quarterbacks of like his era or the Packers. He is of all time. He's probably a top 10 quarterback all time in my opinion and he  First of all, I'll tell you I didn't read the listed first because I just assumed that either star or Hudson would be number one. And then when I learned that they were not then I read the list. So congratulations on doing that to me. You gotta click click a link baby. You click the link. That's what we asked and I think at this point in their careers, I would have star over Rogers just because I think for his era he was better as a quarterback in his era than Rogers has been in his era. He was consistently the best.  Back in his era or the second best quarterback and Rogers was the best quarterback in his era for like five six years and now he's like up top five top ten quarterback in his era. So like that's not as good and I think I'd probably put Rogers behind Favre at this point, but I mean, he's got more career to play out. So that's fine. But star should be higher Hudson should absolutely be number one and it's ridiculous that he wasn't he's the Babe Ruth of the football. He was much better. He is much better than everyone else in his era.  To a to an absurd degree and change the way football was played he holds montlake. He holds passing records the stand up to Modern passing game like scrutiny. He had one season where he led the NFL in receiving yards by like 700 receiving yards. That was number two is five hundred something. So like Don Hudson is definitely the best packet of all time and it was ridiculous that he was three number three, so,  Interesting. This is some takes I don't know if I would I would imagine there many people out there who would say Bart Starr was a better quarterback of his era than Aaron Rodgers is of this one. You got all kinds of recency bias in play, but the average fan thinks of Bart Starr in the ice bolt, you know, they thinks of them with what the pretty good, you know, pretty good familiar guys were blocking form running the football so I could see why people might might undervalue what he's able to do as a pastor. Don Hudson is number one. No that is  Honestly not something I would have thought of I was fine with far if you know and obviously some if you do a list like this, obviously number one its objective number two is splitting hairs. You know, we're talking. I mean, I actually think if you were doing it on pure talent, there's no way fire could possibly be number one. But if you introduce things like narrative and and franchise, you know, iconic whatever substance I do feel like Brett Favre could be at least in the conversation for number one, but that's not that's not how it was ranked, but it's  You know, obviously it's all fun and fun and games good good conversation topic to a try and debate that a lot of guys on that list that I had never heard of, you know very much. It's 1950s and above if their name isn't on the facade, you know, there's a good chance that we've never crossed the you know, that a lot of people have never heard of those names. So it's good to do is some author it was definitely interesting to read for historical purposes. It did still support my hate hate of lists in general, but it was obviously well agree to disagree on that.  I love me. I know you do it was obviously very well did like was super well-researched. There's a lot of good stuff in there about both old-timey and some other guys that you may not remember being as good as they actually were. So right that was did it they were just pulled out of a hat like crystal is as knowledgeable as this is anybody in the planet is alive and obviously Ron wolf has a pretty good sense of the history of the organization as well indeed.  All right. She would do some questions. I pull them up. Let's go. We've got a cup. Let's do it. Let's fire them out. So when we actually sort of answered already, which was Jay Google who ask us questions every week, which is are the guys on the old line the right style of players for La fleurs offensive style and will we see the running backs become an integral part of the passing game. Would you like to go first? I mean you could you're equipped to answer this. All right, I'll go for yeah. Yeah, you don't you tell me I mean offensive line play is a mystery. It's an art form and  They're people understand it like Robert Mays at the ringer understand it stands up. But like all I know is did Aaron Rodgers live. I'm happy with it. Did they get some yards? I'm happy with it. I'm at that level. I do think there's this idea among amongst fans that you can you can be a good pass blocker or a good run blocker, but you can't really be both and I kind of get that because when you're past blocking you are in a passive position in your kind of record on agility to get yourself in position, but it's not as Stark as that and a lot of the time good pass blocking lines are also  Run blocking lines that is the case with the Packers. Those guys are by and large very agile, but also like David bakhtiari is a giant fast man, and whether he is backing up and stonewalling you or rushing forward at you. That is a reason to be terrified for your life. A lot of the other guys. He anchors the side he anchors the pass blocking but that that is a big line. They're good going forward and if they need to, you know, fake run block fake pass block they are  Equipped to do it that he frankly couldn't ask for a better line. If he doesn't get production out of them. He doesn't really deserve to be coach. They're they're great as two running backs in the passing game. It's a it's a it's a weird thing is people I think like to see running backs catch passes. They see screen passes there. They're fun. They look neat you can kind of tell you get excited when you see one developing like when the quarterbacks about to eat it and then it gets rid of the ball but a lot of times running back.  Passes are dump offs and not that exciting and don't get in that many yards. You don't actually run that many plays down the field for running backs. And if you're running a passing play, you're usually not designing it to go to the running back because he is not as good a receiver as the receivers are so there may be a little bit more of that. You might see a little bit more of the screen game. You may see some more aggressive routes like we love Circle routes. If you don't know what that is there when they're running back circles around  Down the middle down the seam. It's a super fun route. It's very effective a lot of the time but it really shouldn't be a focal point of the offense. It might pick up a little bit because McCarthy really did not do it very much, but you might get two NFL average. So you might seem a little bit more involved but it's not something you really want to design too much around its it really is more of just a safety valve thing when it happens and it kind of should be I might not be thinking creatively enough along those lines. Maybe there's something you can do more with that but  extend the top out at 10 yards a catch with some rare exceptions like girly had like 13 one year that's kind of where it lives and that's kind of where it should live. I'd much rather see Davante Adams get an extra 20 targets. Is it an either/or proposition when you've got so many guys rotating into this into the slot position that you know, the Slants and stuff. Are we going to is it if you see more of those does that preclude additional output from the running backs in the passing game or our can you live with both can definitely live with both and if there's going to be some just you know formation  Along those lines where you're using your running back as a weapon of that way, like, you know lineup in power you get the defense to line up against that and then shift and have there any back in the slot and get a mismatch on a linebacker. That's great. That's good play design. It just it's one of those things where the whole play is designed to create mismatches if that's the best one. That's fine take it but you're probably going to have an outside mismatch as well or a tight end mismatch as well and you'd rather have those guys catching passes and so it is  And of an either/or to some extent that running back unless he's very talented as a receiver is probably going to be you know, the second best option at Best On Any Given passing play. I don't know. Yeah, that's that's my thinking on it. So you might see a little bit more of it. But I think people get a little too excited about running backs in the passing game. Go receivers. Who all right. What's next on our question list next on our question list of my phone turned off? Oh from  Work on 14. What would you be willing to give up in draft capital for a competent back up like Nick Mullens or someone along those lines. So I'm not a good person to answer this one because I would never trade anything for a backup quarterback. In fact, I want quinten Rollins back for sha Shan Kaiser. That was terrible. I would Ron's has played pretty well for Cleveland. Yeah. He's kind of a malcontent. But like we gave up quality for garbage in that trade. We definitely lost that trade Nick Mullens.  It does look good. I don't I just if Rogers goes down unless you have an Heir Apparent kind behind him and that's not Nick Mullens. I just don't think it's worth giving up too much capital for because just Seasons kinda over and he might be able to get somebody who can last for a couple games, but you're betting on a very specific set of circumstances. If you do that, like if he misses like six or more your kind of done and there's not much you're going to do about it and giving up any draft capital on the speculative idea that you can find a backup quarterback that can go like to and  And for games, I just don't think it's worth that. I really have that Capital to make the defense better and that gives you a better chance. Anyway, yeah, we talked about this last week with why don't they just move on from Kaiser and it's pretty clear that they still see something in him. They think he's a project that can still be developed. I mean, I think that most of us at this point don't agree with that assessment but it does make sense. There's some wisdom to just you know, letting him be they're developing and and if Aaron Rodgers goes  Down, you know God forbid or whatever. They could maybe make a move at that point depending on where they are in the season what Maneuvers are available to them if they feel like they had to but but like you said anything they can get for a couple draft picks right now is not going to rise the tight enough that you'd expect them to be able to pull it together. I mean, I think Matt Flynn actually in the Lexicon of backup quarterbacks the year that even managed to get them these the improbable number of wins. I think that's 2013 to hold on until Aaron Rodgers return like  Flint's probably about as good as you can get and he wasn't he wasn't great. But that was that was as good as it gets. So there's not a there's not going to be anything out there. That's Martin. I mean there might be something that's markedly better than to Shawn Kaiser but not enough. It's going to make it make a difference in the grand scheme of what or not you have a winning or losing season. Yeah agreed with that. I would I would cycle through guys more frequently than they do. I don't like how long they hold onto clearly bad quarterbacks. I would I just I would draft one or sign a journeyman like every year to a one-year deal and see how they are.  Yeah at this point they need to start looking for the next guy to like it's about that time. This is Aaron's age 36 Days in which means after the next draft. It'll be his age 37 season and that's when it's time to start looking for the next quarter back. So yeah next year when you hear the words taysom Hill. What do you think? Do you feel like the back really screwed up there? I kind of do I don't think he's that good but but like just at the time I think he was  Not clearly the best guy there but there was a good chance. He was the best guy there. They definitely should have given him I think more of a shake than that and I mean kudos to the Saints for finding other creative ways to use them now. He is not been a good passer in the rare chance times and games when he's thrown passes. He's like 1 for 3 with an interception. I think something like that. So, you know, he really is a running weapon, but I'll say this I would rather have a quarterback whose legs make him a weapon as my backup then one whose arm makes him a weapon because the back  In this league cannot pass very well. And it's easier to find a guy who's good at running and you can build like a garbage Tebow offense or you know, something along those lines for two and a half three games with a guy like that until the league, you know gets wise to it and Scouts it and shuts it down. Like I'd kind of rather take my chances with the guy like taysom Hill doing that now I want to be clear. I don't think he's good. But but like I would rather have him by far than either of the guys we have right now.  Yeah, this is one of those to bring it back to baseball. They're just some players that that franchise is figure out how to use best and I'm not sure even if he stays with the Packers they wind up figuring out how to unlock what he had to the table. I think he had to go somewhere else to be discovered this way. So probably true. Yeah. All right. So one more and then we'll wrap up. This is we actually talked about this a little bit already. But from Chase Richard if Rogers doesn't play it all in the preseason. Is it fair to say that he's running the team to an extent or that looks layer is easy to inflate.  Winds. So first of all, I think like I said, I think they're on the same page about him not playing her playing and if Aaron Rodgers wants to not play in a preseason game. All he has to do is go into his coach's office and say I don't want to play in the preseason game. So the fact of the matter is he does run the team to some extent he has huge pole and I don't think that's a secret at all when you're Aaron Rodgers coach, you know, when you when you manage people by the way, this is going to be annoying. I apologize in advance yet. You got two kinds of Power you got  you have real power and you have soft power real power is when you say I'm your boss go do it people do that, but they won't do a very good job the key to being a good NFL head coach has soft power. It is to convince guys to do a good job because they want to impress you they want you to like them you they want they respect you and want you to you know, show a mutual respect. That's what you want. So Rogers is going to throw his weight around if you want to do because you can because he's important but  It's not fair to say that he's running the team because he does that because if Aaron Rodgers walks in and says that nobody's going to tell them no and they shouldn't not just because earned it but like he knows his body best and he knows how to prep best for himself, you know and LeFleur wants to get him to buy a new system. He's got to make him respect him and actually do a good job of doing that in managing. It's not it's not enough to just be there and tell them what to do. Nobody works like that. This podcast is at its absolute best when it's describing.  Power and I definitely hope we can do some Machiavelli next week. I love I love where this is going. Well, yeah, that's a that's more of a Raiders show. I think but yeah that that's a good idea to do you watch succession on HBO speaking of power. I've heard it's good, but I have not watched tremendous. It is such a good show. Oh, I love it so much. I mean, I love this. I love the show. I hate all the people. It's kind of like it's kind of like watching the bait the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team. I love the show with me painful.  Beyond in the background which is why I think of that right now, I like all the people it's just been it's been rough. But but yeah, it's it's such a good show if we're talking about power. We could I think Aaron Rodgers would enjoy succession. I mean he I know he enjoys Game of Thrones imagine because the politics involved in Game of Thrones. I bet you he loves succession entirely possible. I do think he's a big sci-fi fantasy nerd too though. I mean, he loves the yes, that is right. So that's that hits him in his whole wheel house. I think yeah. All right.  Should we should wrap this guy up here? That's the language. Yeah, let's do it. We're going to Winnipeg right we're going to do this live next live from from Manitoba. We are not doing that at all. I got a passport and my passports over I need to get a new one if we're gonna do it mines mines about nine years, which is when you should start redoing it because I think if you're nine and six months, they won't actually let you back in the country so highly yeah, so just everybody knows that get your passport or dude regularly, especially I mean right now,  Going to terrible time to be stuck in Canada not be allowed back in but but yeah, that's definitely I'm definitely past nine months. It's more or nine years. It's more like I don't know 20 since I last left the country. So okay. The girl act 1999 is the last time I left this country. So so yeah, it's a little outdated indeed. All right anything you want to plug before we sign off Jr. Know, you know, so we talked about Rashad on Gary actually talk to talk to his his old college teammate been bredesen from Arrowhead High School.  Cool, and he is a preseason first-team All-American according to the Associated Press take that for what you will but it's it was good catching up with him. He's an offensive guard for the University of Michigan. He's going to be in the NFL next year. He's exceptional at what he does you no offense of guardi. I don't know if he's a first-round guy probably a more like a early third late second type of guy, but definitely one of the best at his craft in the country and coming from the state of Wisconsin, so caught up with him a little bit. It's got to be weird to be you know, we're shy  Period and David Bush and there's another guy they all came into the same time. It's gonna be weird to watch all those guys that you came to college with going to the NFL and start making a paycheck and you're really good at football still and he's still at college, but that should that should post some time on Tuesday and or not Tuesday Wednesday, and for the most part, that's all I got cooking right now. All right. Well, I had my review of the last came up in the shepherd Express on Tuesday. I wrote a lot about your son Gary and his struggles so far and later this week at ACME Packing Company.  I'm going to have a comparison between HaHa Clinton Dicks and Adrian Amos the pedal Licious embarrassed traded safeties in the offseason the Bears media and actually the national media thinks that the Bears got the better end of this deal. I can assure you that that is not true and I'm actually discussing sort of why people think that and there are totally legitimate and so I would say innocent reasons that that is the case, but I will go over all of those in detail. I'm going to be diving into that that is that is a tasty.  That you're serving up there and you actually one more thing. I thought of I did this collaboratively with PL EV over at the Journal Sentinel. We the Pfizer form is coming up on one year of operation and we ranked our favorite 14 events, including Sports and rare and concerts. I know you I know you're a music guy too. And there were some phenomenal shows. It is impossible to imagine a better year than what Pfizer form in Milwaukee had this past year when it comes to you know, Mark had bucks going to of course the Eastern Conference Finals they had just  Just Ariana Grande Justin Timberlake Metallica The Killers like, you know, big comedy routines just an amazing slate. So so we raked are our favorite 14 sports sports event. May or may not be number one. I don't know. All right, cool. Looking forward to reading that. It sounds great. Yes. Okay. Well until next time thanks everybody for listening. You can download the show usually every Wednesday and we will have a few patreon reward announcements going on.  Pretty soon actually maybe in this very podcast. I'll see if I get to recording it.\"],\n",

Go check it out download the free anchor app or go to Anchored off dot f m-- to get started. Okay, let's get back to the show.  Today's words are fatuous, silly and pointless apocryphal.  Of doubtful authenticity, although widely circulated as being true usually in regards to a story or statement a credit e having an acrid smell accurate is having an irritant Lee Strong and unpleasant taste or smell angry bitter.

Trump trump Trump trump no matter what you think of him. You got to admit. He's very entertaining especially when it comes to his tweets.  A lot of his tweets are completely fascists. Remember the the whole kafei tweet where he tweeted a word that said Kofi. I like 2:00 in the morning unbelievable. Basically all of his tweets are trenchant. He's very bold once everyone to listen every once in a while though. He'll have a rather euphonious comment. I assume those pleasing tweets are in by his professional speech writers right now is impeachment trial is  Underway, some say is conversation with Ukrainian president clearly frames it but others say it that is apocryphal. We'll just have to see what happens.  That's all for GRE vocab. We wish you guys the best of luck if you're taking the test this week.
