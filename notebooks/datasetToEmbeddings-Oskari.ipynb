              " 'documents': [[\"s and damage is silly. I don't consider two thousand damage in 10 kills impressive in a game mode like this that makes 100% sense just because that's like that happens in like domination on like Modern Warfare when  It's like you just have some guy going around KD. He's always worried about his KD rather than I don't know capturing the damn point, you know, totally male confirmed is the biggest offender. Oh my God. It's oh that's so bad in Modern Warfare because no one grabs the tags. Like there's no point cut this game. But some people feel like they need to screen cap to make themselves feel good because of the meta of course is using some very variety. Sorry of  caustic Watson Bloodhound and Bangalore. The first point is essential in casual Lobby because you can get set up for the defense while the other two squads worry about getting each other again, totally stupid. Yep, but if all three teams that know what they are doing and the final train is to to to situation is absolutely a blast. So my take is that it would be fun.  If it's a custom lobby with eight of your closest friends, but since we can't do private matches yet. I hate this for me. It's worse than Shadow Fall with the exception of the first day or two. I'd go about every other match with a win and it's fun as hell. But like I said either the third team is lame or lazy or it's just a CQC kill Fest and last  I checked that isn't Call of Duty. I guess I get what you're saying. I get it I get it. Yeah, I I like I like this mode just because of how different is. However, I could totally see how you know having somebody drop out or whatever is super annoying because that's super annoying even just in the Battle Royale mode look like dude. I was going for your banner like what the hell stop being such a pussy, you know? Yeah, but yeah, I could totally see how depending on your matches.  Totally, you know because I feel like one of the things that did make me like this game is how much I was winning. So yeah, so I could see like coming from the other, you know perspective of if I'm losing every other one or I'm only winning and when I do in it's just because the other people are being dumb so then it doesn't feel like a true win because it's like if you're just in the train and then they eliminate each other and you didn't really do that much. I could totally see how that's just like, I'm bored. Yeah and not to compare.  R this to Call of Duty but what he's saying sounds a lot about what I said at the top of the show about shipment. Yeah where it's like the chaos is fun. Sometimes other times. It's frustrating when ever I literally spawn and I get killed immediately someone just camping at that spot. So it's one of those that I I can see I'm glad that they wrote in and had these different takes because it's one of those I'm like, I love it because the chaos and other people are like the chaos is great. But sometimes the chaos is too much so it's cool to have that.  Economy their of those different sponsors, which is of course, the reason why we do this show and why we were building this community is to is to have everybody be a part of the conversation. Definitely so we can have you know, a unified group. Yep. Super super great. Thank you guys for writing in to us. You guys can also write in to us go to Discord or Twitter at official Noob and that spelled just like the show official in e  Hubie that's at official Noob on Twitter or our thread X3 Twitter at tx3 Productions. All right. So let's move on to our last segment of the day, would you rather?  Alright, would you rather obviously super simple premise, would you rather this or would you rather that I would you rather that I would you rather that. So once again, please write in to us we will come up with our own ideas, but the more ideas the better. So this is kind of just to end the show on a nice fun note. Where would you rather this or would you rather?  That so first, let's start it off. Super simple first or third person. Like are we talking about games? Are we talking about in real life? What I rather see you ever confront their third person. I would totally love in IRL is what the hipsters are calling it new and youth. Yeah. Could you imagine being third person in real life and just being like like walking up? I wouldn't bleep. Yeah. I'm just reading it will see past me don't be so cool that would know but I mean like video games this is  Okay much rather. Here's the Centrist years the Citrus on the show. Depends on what you like second person. Is that is that what you want you here inside? Here's the situation because you obviously don't understand. How would you rather fucking works? Okay, and would you rather in this particular case is would you like there to only be first person games or only be third person? You literally have to Nate. You have to choose one either third person is never  Existed or first person has never existed in the history of video games. Okay, that's an easy one for me. I'd say third person then yeah. Yeah for sure because it's one of those that if I think about it, factually there is a lot more Masterpiece and extremely high quality games that are third person over first person that we would never get like imagine a world where we didn't ever have the last of us where we never had Uncharted where we never  Add any game that's third prime mean you're kind of left with like Call of Duty Doom Halo, which is there's still plenty of like first-person experiences and to say that we wouldn't have gotten The Last of Us in first person, you know, I'd have to disagree we could have gotten it in first. It's just that we wouldn't have seen the back of you know, Joel's head for, you know, 20 hours.  Oh, we're Ellie spoiler. I think I still would pick third person. Yeah. Yeah. I was a person I would have to agree with you. But to be contrarian the best thing about first person is that immersion is feeling like you're in the world. You can still feel immersed in a third person game that's not impossible, but it's also harder because when I see the person I'm not me reacting the way I would react.  A situation. I'm geralt. I'm Leon. I am that character and then I start thinking about what would this character? Perfect example is Grand Theft Auto in Grand Theft Auto V. I would play differently depending on who I was. Yep. Yep. If I was Trevor I would get up, you know, and if I was Michael, I'd be a little bit more reserved. I mean, I would certainly run over a person here or there, but I would be a  A little bit more reserved and if I was Franklin, I felt a little bit in between. You know, I might be like hey, I'm a Gangster. So it's okay if I hold up this liquor store, but you know, I'm also not trying to get caught and not a freakin psychos. You know, I play somewhere in between. Yeah every eye with Franklin for me like since he was the youngest of the two characters. He was the one that I always used as my avatar. Yeah. So like I would go and less you a punk. That's why yeah, I would go we'd get like nice cars we go.  Drinks with my we became besties. So my point my point being is that I wasn't playing myself because I was playing Franklin. I was playing Trevor. I was playing Michael and so my point being is that in a first person game even if I have a name, even if I have a voice I feel like it's me playing the game and I am the one making the decisions. I'm more immersed into the world. I'm more I want to say emotionally invested because obviously the last of us would be a really good example of like being third person but still being emotionally  Best in but still it's like I'm that person and so it's really hard to say that like it's really hard to say first person never existing third person granted we wouldn't have things like I mean like platforms, you know, or that just means that you have to platform in a different way, you know, yeah, so I don't know it's a really hard for me to say that like never having because like horror games are just so much better in first person.  You feel the fear of somebody right behind you. That is something that you just don't get as much in a third person game. I feel like the primary third person game that I felt even though I could see the character. I was the most invested in immersed in was God of War fought a war. Yeah. I felt like that was I was Kratos. Like that was my journey throughout and I'm just you know, it's kind of like moss when he played Moss where it's like, I'm the Observer watching this, but I'm completely immersed.  So I can see where you're coming from with that. Yeah, first person of course is pivotal and it's one of those that that that's a really good one II appreciate how complex that way instead of yet. We do you would you want first for sure. It doesn't seem simple but it is kind of complex if you really think about it. I mean final answer for me. I guess I would say third person. I just had to be contrarian in the sense of his like but ya know first third.  First flip a coin if it helps third third participant final 200 Witcher O'Malley plenty already plenty check out nerd radio with our review of that plug plug plug plug plug. All right, let's go next one. Like how I got away with not answering. Yeah pretty much. So with this one tying it back to Apex. This is an interesting one.  Would you rather have all of the Power and abilities of rape be able to teleport me will go through interdimensional Rifts things like that cool stuff like that. But you also have to deal with the repercussions of like you have the voices and you're being torn apart at any given moment. You have to deal with all the trauma. She goes true or B Octane and have his abilities of this really cool jump pad also being able to go super fast and  Just being a lot more agile mobile and I'd like to repeat that but you also have to deal with being a drug addict and you're in immense pain from losing your legs to an explosion. Yeah, see that's and that's an interesting one because teleportation and mental pain or quick quick easy fast fast and physical pain. That's that's definitely that's definitely intriguing because it's like mental pain can still manifest in a physical way.  Versus physical pain you can get rid of with physical means I yeah drugs. So being a drug addict might not be that bad and also mental pain can be a lot worse than physical pain as physical pain has its limits mental pain does not. Yeah. Oh God. No, it doesn't that's it. Actually interdimensional. Yeah with its and I mean the backstory for wraith essentially shows that you're hearing all of her voices from all.  All the dimensions, you know, it's like you're telling yourself somebody's aiming at me, you know what? I mean? It's but that's a different that's like so you have like a hundred use all arguing with each other all the fuckin time. I don't know if I could handle that. You know, I could barely handle me talking to myself. I mean, I don't do that anyways, um, but that's that's a hard one because it's like the teleportation is so obviously we're talking in real life so far data in real life our day to day.  Being able to go invisible essentially essentially go invisible or teleport or just instead of having to have a car essentially I could just run around Jump Around Jump Around jump jump jump. Um God, that's really hard. That's that's a that's an interesting one. I don't know. I think I have to go octane because the physical pain is definitely would be hard and I being a drug addict would be hard but  But I just be like those voices and that mental thing that would that would kill me, you know drugs I think would have been truly kill me, but I wouldn't care about it because I'll just try but I don't do drugs kids by the way. We're not saying do drugs. We're in this particular circumstance. I feel like the physical pain versus the mental. It's just it's too much too much. I don't think I'd be able to handle it. I wear it. I have to agree on this one. Okay, I  Yet I couldn't deal with that mental anguish it I've always wanted to teleport and that's probably my most desired superpower but a couple things with with wraith. It's you're right the physical pain, you can always overcome and find a way to mask it also and this is definite more of a visual thing. So you'll you'll see this on the video here. Imagine. If you were imagine you would be making the news not for being a vigilante, but you would have some guy Ariana get on this way to work. It's just  I'm gonna streak going like just off the street. Yeah. Also, if you saw the I just ran to my other day, so there is that it's a very tiny room. I'm in right now. I mean, is that better or worse than just appearing though? Because I mean at least running it's like hey, he's getting his cardio in and it's exactly agent. It's a great way to see ya. All right. That's it. That's a good one. All right, here's a real quick one. Would you rather marry Mirage or caustic?  like caustic would cure your cancer, but also might kill all your friends if he doesn't like them and Mirage is super annoying to listen to  I think I'd have to pick Mirage. I feel like I would get so War plenty would be awesome. Exactly exactly all those hands. So I think I would read both of them would be annoying because you would be annoyed thinking that Kasich was going to kill all your friends be annoyed with Mirage because I don't like people so maybe it wouldn't be that bad. Just be like honey. He's just kind of pissing it. Can you just can you just I'm gonna say I'm gonna say Mirage  Just because I feel like I could put up with that more. And also I think the sex would be awesome. Yeah, I don't know under that Gruff man. You don't think fat people need love, huh? No, I do but I think that's why dude stinks because he drops gas everywhere. So I mean the other way just hang say you would eventually become numb to that and you wouldn't even smell it. Okay, plus he would pray if you're married to him. I would assume that he would give you a gas mask so you don't have to smell anything. Boom. Just solve that problem. Now what?  Okay, I'm done with this. Now. I think caustic because I feel like he's a scientist. Okay, he could cure my ills and get rid of people that I'm pissed off at. Okay, so don't cross me because my boy JB block will come at you. Okay, and that's the end of our show. All right guys, thank you so much for tuning in to the very first episode of noob. We're so excited to have all our nice experiences.  Of buddies, so make sure to join us at official Noob and that spelled just like the show official in E WB that's at official Noob on Twitter and make sure to get obviously this is a new thing. We're trying out. We want to have fun. We want to we want to cover some extra videos or whatever so or video video games. So I mean first biggest question of the week.  Other than respond to everything right into us your you know, your would you rather as your tunes to die for write in to us about all that? But the biggest question of the week is going to be what should we cover? You know, I want to say a super obvious one would be obviously Apex, you know, come on. Come on guys. We have to kick we have to stay on that train at but a super obvious one for me at least would be I would like to cover dauntless cross.  Play cross-platform cross progression, you know, there's a lot of grinding in it. Yes, but it's like I feel like that one's a super easy one if you had to throw one out, what would you throw out? Um, well for for a fact that I'm going to put this out there. I am going to talk a lot about Call of Duty Modern Warfare on the show. What what you I think that has I think that also has a lot to do with the fact that it goes into the same thing because it is it's not cross progression, but it is cross-platform episode. This is this is the most mainstream  Stream shooter out now that everyone can play together. So I mean I'm gonna give you a warning if you got tired of me talking about Call of Duty. You're not gonna it's not gonna get any better. Yeah, but I mean dauntless is a good one because it's one of those that you show me a lot of games. Do I play a lot of them? No, but dauntless do I play a lot of still? No, but I know for a fact that I enjoy it and I think it's cool. And then we capture isn't one. Yeah. Yeah an easy one is Minecraft Minecraft.  The OG cross-platform game and it's one of those that I have been dying to pick it back up again. So if you guys have Minecraft or you're interested in playing it feel free to let me know and I will I will press the button I will make the purchase happen and I will get it again because I have been really looking to play it really looking to play Minecraft. Yeah. So yeah, so I mean, that's our thoughts. What do you guys think? We should cover cross-platform games are going to be really nice just so that we can actually play together because that was the one thing that kind of sucked about Apex.  X is that since we were stuck on the PlayStation we couldn't really interact with everybody. So cross-play is going to be a big factor. It won't be the only one but it'll be a big one rocket league is a good one for class platform classic rock waffle on brawlhalla is a good fighter and we can cross play on that one. So there's a couple out there that I think would be really nice to cover but we definitely want to hear from you guys what you think we should cover what you think we should talk about and everything. So let us know obviously you can  The comments you can go to Discord, which is in the description. You can go to Twitter at official Noob or our thread X3 Productions at tx3 Productions or email us directly at threat X3 Productions at gmail.com. So once again, I was your host Nick and I was your host name and remember always play nice and use the buddy system, but hey,\",\n",
              "   \"ple of rounds already before you finally go down that you know, downsizing downsides or something and in general sometimes just getting the firefight started first can sometimes be what wins and losses. So if you kind of train yourself and it's definitely something once again, just like don't reload after five shots. It's something you have to kind of consciously think.  Till it becomes a reflex until it becomes, you know, cuz it's also different because another another angle of mind. Your trigger finger is the exact opposite. If your long-distance you want to take that extra, you know half second to make sure am I even aiming at the person because I you know, I don't know how many times I would aim down sights and maybe I'd be a little bit to the left a little bit to the right, you know, and so then you might waste one or two shots because  you're not aiming at the person and then you finally get over to them. But then you also have to take into account like recoil and stuff like that. So how many shots are you actually missing because you didn't take that extra little bit to just make sure that you're lined up properly final thing to add on to that pay attention to the game mechanics. Oh, yeah definitely names often than not nowadays are giving you the option for fully auto semi auto sometimes burst. Yeah and warfare. Does that, you know again for an example with that so going into  Your long range and let's say you only have an assault rifle or submachine gun. If you have a submachine gun, I would try to get closer for sure. But if you have something like an assault rifle if it gives you if the game gives you the option to do something Auto and you feel like you'd be more confident popping off a couple of shots like that switch to that because you might very well be a lot more accurate with just one round down the range rather than going fully automatic and have a lot of recoil there. So that's something that I forget a lot of the times I forget that that feature exists in most games.  Sort of games. So I'll be spray and pray at that point trying to go a long distance and I was like, well, I could have been a little bit more accurate and try to discount it out a little bit more. So yeah, and that kind of goes in to be mindful of your surroundings in the game as well as watching the game. Yeah, and I mean like a good rule of thumb would be like Outdoors semi-auto indoors fully-auto. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean in a lot of cases it just depends on like what you want to actually do so our next segment. It's a nice little fun one.  called Tunes to die for  Now this is like the other ones this is going to be very interactive. We're more looking for maybe not necessarily suggestions, but you can very well give us some we kind of want to know what the music is that you guys listen to you while you game or if you do it all. Yeah, if you don't tell us why tell us why you prefer to do the game itself. I think it varies on game like if I'm playing Call of Duty, I totally comfortable just like pounding out some, you know, some like hip-hop or like maybe  Some like rock or something and just having it in the background versus a more like methodical Battle Royale that can be a little bit more like, okay, I need to focus so I don't want to have the music blaring in the background. Yeah, and you know, what's funny is I used the media player feature on the Xbox 360 a lot. Yeah, like I used it a lot. I can remember playing not really multiplayer mostly campaign missions that I'd already gone through and like playing like Eminem or like some  Be good Hype. Music. Did you try it yourself in the moment myself in the moment. Yeah, you want it? Yeah, own it. I got Never Let It Go never and I will admit I even did a card and I even did a cardinal sin every now and again with playing some playing some older Halo games with my own music instead of the soundtrack. So that's that's not something I would fully recommend. But yeah, I can remember back in the day doing that a lot, you know, just plug in USB drive in but now  You know with these consoles that have things like Spotify and Pandora on them. I hardly ever use them. But for me personally the main the really only time that I will use Spotify, you know while I'm playing or you know, playing on my PlayStation is if I'm trying to grind so if I'm good point like playing like Far Cry New Dawn I think was the last time I did it I put on this really kind of I looked for a post-apocalyptic sounding playlist to like well I could grind  And out resources. It's like hanging on trash cans and stuff is really cool. Like it was a lot of that really kind of old country like not old country. But where you have those like burnt down don't it's like really concussive that almost sounded like the corn home and like the porn hub in trouble, you know that to well that's also a meme now, but that's the main thing that  I really use it for nowadays. I don't typically do it for multiplayer because I want to win I don't want to be distracted especially with a lot of these games nowadays using like saying hey, you should use headphones so you can hear footsteps and stuff like that. Hey listen, but for me personally what I find a lot of the times what I'll use is going to Spotify and going to their gaming section. Mmm, one of the reasons why I love Spotify in general is because I can play music by my  Dude, if I'm feeling like a sad little depressed boy, I can play some depressing music. If I feel happy, I can play some happy music and it's the same way with gaming, you know, you have things from hip-hop gaming to power gaming which is more like you're in a fight you're ready to you know stuff like I Will Not Bow and just like stuff like that definition Army only seven. Yeah, but there's so many different categories that you can choose from to kind of fit.  Game, you're playing. You know Grand Theft Auto Final Fantasy Need for Speed. You've got like soundscapes. So if you're playing a really pretty open world game and you want to get friends in there. It's really it's really designed to fit one for one. I think it's really really cool. So that's what I typically use Spotify. Yeah. I'm in Spotify is a pretty good one. I feel like what I'm listening to I've been listening to a lot of clothes pull up loast. I've been listening to a lot of Postman.  Alone lately. I was just a couple of his like have some really good beats to it. And then like there's this one channel on Pandora. Actually that I have 80's 90's 2000s and today so it's like there's just some I don't know. I think it's just a tea or it's 90s 2000s and today. Well, that's just some like, you know, like there's some good 90 songs that come on you just like oops, I did it again. Oh God. I'm why was I not expect you to do that? That's my  Follow, but know sometimes this is like, you know, I mean kind of like what you were saying as far as like just if all I'm doing is grinding or if I just have some dailies to get rid of, you know, I'm really close to getting that weekly challenge or something like that, you know, just popping on some music and just having fun with it and I feel like that's super important, you know, because like if you want to take it serious, that's cool. Take it serious, you know, but I feel like every once in awhile no matter how serious you take it. I feel like it's still  will important for you to just have fun with the game, you know, so schedule yourself some time to just play a game put some tunes on and just have fun with it, you know, so, I mean, I feel like that's so important because like going through and massacring people while Don't Stop Believing is blaring in your ears is fucking awesome little little side note. Have you seen that video of someone?  Together of the fight scene towards the end of the rise of Skywalker where they put I need a hero I'll drive the building is phenomenal and it's so good. It is so good. Obviously those floors and every city. Yeah, but like it's a hero to the owner. Oh, that's hilarious. Yeah, but yeah, we want to know we want to know what kind of music you guys listen to you while you play and if you don't what do you like to listen to if it's not the the  In-game music. Yeah, yeah, definitely. All right, so then let's get on to the topic of the show.  The top of the show today is actually the winner Express, you know, obviously we have that nice limited time mode for Apex by the time you're listening to it. It ends tomorrow. So if you have it, you know plated enough, please go in check it out. It's really cool. So what are your first thoughts on it when?  You when you started playing it genuinely. I love it yard. Like it's one of those that I feel like this is the first limited time mode that they've rolled out apart from solos that I feel they knew what they were doing on. Mmm and works the best. Yep. Also, it gives another layer to Apex that we haven't had much of that. I want more often. Yes, first off, you know when we talked about in the last I think it was the last episode we had of apex of a hub cast.  Where I was talking about my favorite thing about you know, the new map is the train like the idea of going down and you know, it's a heist like it's a nice kind of thing. Now them actually doing that adding that is like cool in and of itself but it also adds this really cool King of the Hill Capture the Flag chaotic everyone is facing each other instead of trying to survive kind of feeling and you know, which is weird for me to say because I've always been the type of person that I'm not going to Hot Drop anywhere just  Not going to do it because I want to survive in the main battle royale, but for this like it feels like a objective game mode that it was is balanced in a way but also just feels like it was properly made. It doesn't feel like it was thrown together if that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah, I 100% agree just because it's like it just feels like they actually thought about it because they didn't just think about you know, they didn't just think about okay, let's just throw them on the train. It's like they also  Thought about okay. What's the route that it can take? Like, it doesn't take certain turns because it's trying to stay like in that Center Circle or whatever and I really like that. I'm like, okay, that's kind of cool. There are very few things that like, I feel like could be different but kind of like what you're saying about how like this is one of the first limited time modes where it actually feels like put together. I want to see more of this. I want to see more thoughtful limited time modes rather than you know, obviously  our throw a limited time modes like gun gold guns only that would be cool. But that would be such a throwaway one. You know, how often would you honestly play that you might do a couple rounds just for the fun of it, but this legit this legit feels like something like if you have a team deathmatch and a domination hmm, like it's something that could exist in last right? Right. But yeah also the little things that are wrong with it. I feel like can be ironed out like for instance.  Something in this happened during the runtime. One thing that they changed is like as long as you were on the train, you couldn't take it over or you could take it over. So there were people getting in the end cars and just staying in there. And if you held up pretty well, then everybody was just SOL because like especially you get a Gibraltar in there and a caustic in there. Like if you get held up in there and you know, like it could it could just you know be the end.  The rest of the teams and you get all three capture points in a row because they just could not come down on you giggity. So one thing that they changed almost immediately is that then they started making it change. So then it's like it could be the center, you know car. It could be the end cart or it could be like hardpoint kind of yeah, it's so it would move sometimes and that was really nice because like that could have been abused very much. So, I don't know if that was a thing from the very beginning.  Oh like so don't I'm sure there's somebody yelling at me probably but I don't think that was a thing from the beginning. I remember just being able to be on any of the carts and it take it over, you know, which granted it could have just been me getting used to the game. So maybe they you know, I don't know anyways, either way. It's it's a nice addition one thing. I wish maybe they would have done and maybe this is something they could do is that since they know the route that the thing is going on maybe drop sprinkle.  In some power-ups, you know because it is nice to have it is nice to know that everybody has a kind of Level Playing Field. Everybody has blue armor. Everybody has, you know certain attachments on their guns. I really really like that about it. But at the same time it makes the surrounding areas just kind of you know bullet sponges, you know, get behind something and let it soak up some bullets or something. It would be nice to maybe see some kind of a power up thing.  No, I don't think gold armor should ever, you know be there. I don't think you know, but just I don't know maybe supply drops, you know, maybe something something along that lines just to kind of give you a chance and also give you like a secondary objective be like, okay, I could go to the train or I could go get the supply drop which gives me an LSAT or a Mastiff, you know, something like that. It was like, okay now I have a secondary objective. I have something else to focus on.  On you know, and that kind of gives you that risk reward by going to the supply drop. I'm risking, you know up everybody going the supply drop or losing that objective. But by going to that supply drop it gets me more equipped for the next one and I can just you know, I can just clean your house on the next round. So some risk reward would be really cool. Yeah, I think one of the things that I want to point out that kind of goes into the cohesiveness of the mode itself.  Is the way that the train revolving around the different stations works with like the exhaust vents and the real ass like it's so it works so well together. It's like, oh you just got off the track. Okay run a little bit. There's these exhaust vents right just off of it and that helps you reapply because every like that few hundred yards to like so you don't have to go that far. Yeah, it feels this is that that in and of itself is partially why I feel like this is the most cohesive new mode they've added because it makes me want to play Apex.  Currently and I want to continue to play Apex that way. Yeah, but I don't know if this was just me but I feel like I was leveling up super fast on this mode. Well, it's like it kind of goes back to what I was saying is it's a lot more chaotic. So, I mean you're you're engaging a lot more than typically you would per per minute in a normal eight X. We're getting way more freaking kills in this one and honest. Um, oh I just lost it long bow. Okay. I lost it for a second. I never  You use the Longbow because I'm not a big sniper. And for some reason I started using the Longbow in this game mode, you know, one of the strategies that I felt like a lot of people started picking up is instead of trying to land right on the train they land on the outskirts and try to pick off the other teams as they try to go in and that was me I get that LSAT get a couple of really good shots or whatever knock them down. It felt so good but in a normal  Normal circumstance if I'm dropping in a regular bottle real and I drop in and I see you know a longbow. I'm probably going to pass it up. I'm going to be like nah, thanks. I'm going to take this over here. I'm going to take a G7 instead. But in this particular game mode like I started using it and I'm like, okay and it got me comfortable enough with that in a battle royale now, I do kind of second think do I want that Longbow, you know, and that's something that is so great about having a really cool limited time.  Load like this is that it just gets you thinking in a different way. That's awesome. Yeah, and I don't know if this is necessarily like a tip or anything. So I'm not going to leave it as one but looking up some other people's gameplays of a cause. I want to see how much better everyone is than me, but also to kind of see how everyone else plays I've seen that be the kind of consistent thing of like Longbow primary alternator or some sort of other submachine gun secondary, right, you know to get you close quarters on the train and the other parts and then one of the things I think has been my  right thing from watching this different gameplay eclipse is people more and more that I've seen all these videos trying to kill the people on the Reed who are redeploying from the Vets. They are like looking for them and like they're trying to pick them up before they land. So that kind of goes into what you were saying about picking them off before they get to the train. Yeah, definitely. Alright, so we actually got some feedback from this limited time mode from some of our Discord Members First two responses come from Scott Squatch on our Discord and he says,  It was a fun mode. It was a fun mode. But very chaotic. You couldn't use audio that much to track players. If you use certain characters, it would help like Bangalore and Bloodhound caustic or Mirage those work best for the chaos that happens on that train. Also, I like the features of The Load-Out switching makes makes it feel fresh every day that you play it. He also responded with also there's one trick you could do with winter Express that I don't know. If a lot of players knew that is that you were able to fully kit.  One of your teammates by that, I mean that you couldn't drop guns, but you could drop hop ups and attachment making one O.P. Gun for your team. So I think what he's saying there is you basically could have it to where one of the team members has a power weapon that they could be so it kind of regulate relegating to maybe like you've got the team sniper or the team Powerhouse or something like that with the hop-up. They were able to drop you could have for one O.P. Gun pert. Yeah. Yeah, I think which makes sense because like  If there was ever like a G7 that had double tap, but you wanted to give that to you know, somebody with the ev8 that didn't have the double tap that could really make that close counters guy a lot better at what he's doing because I don't feel like especially in the sniper type of situation. You don't really need d double tap for a sniper situation, but you need that double tap in that Ebates. If you want to be on that train, you gotta ride that train. Come on, right address. Yeah. See, I it's funny that he says it was fun, but very chaotic me personally, that's  That's why I liked it a lot of animals because I don't play Apex chaotically. I play it strategically so I know exactly exactly that, you know, like I was saying before it's just it's something different, you know, and I feel like that's just the best thing that's the best thing is to do something different take this universe that I love and make me experience it in a different way. Nothing wrong with that. So then we had one from hurdle 3K the mode is totally dependent on the other two squads.  Ironically, if one Squad goes up 2-0. I've seen the third Squad quit the game basically handing them a victory but the worst part. Oh wait, but the worst part when one squad has to and you are you and the third Hawk God dang it. I can't read. I'm sorry when one squad has to you and the third Squad have one or zero and the other Squad starts blasting at you before the  Rain, even arise conventional logic would say you go 6 B 3 and then duke it out for the capture after that the amount of times I've seen thirsty people. Those are the worst. Just trying to rack up kill\",\n",
              "   \"ituations not a lot but there are certain situations where like maybe I'd zip in I'd want to do some stuff be like, okay. This is not going my way. I want to just zip back out. Yeah. Now let me ask you on guns. Where you at on guns. I mean I feel  Everybody can agree that Peacekeeper is super Opie. I mean the fire rate sort of fixes that problem. But at the same time you get somebody who's a good clutch player the Pisco. Oh my God. Okay. So we're down to the last round. There are three other people I start unloading with the Spitfire I get, you know.  You know, I'm spraying a lot but giggity I'm spraying a lot but I want to say I hit him five maybe six times. Of course. He had like a level 3 armor, but so did I this mf'er hit me twice toe Weiss and I was dead granted. Both of them might have been in my head, but what the f two shots and I was down.  And I was already like okay. This happened to be one where both of the randos dropped out. So I'll my attention was already way up because I was by myself, you know what I mean? And so then they be shot twice. I'm like, I felt robbed I felt so robbed and I feel like shotguns. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like shotguns is always a point of contention for a lot of shooter fans because I feel like in most cases people are like, oh my God, they're just to Opie.  Yeah, especially when you have a case like Modern Warfare 2 s 1887 which is now been classified as the best sniper rifle in the game because the range on it was ridiculous. But yeah, I know it that's always been the case with shotguns. Now. There's there's a the thing with them about them is it's a very delicate balance on getting it to work, right, you know like and there's only been certain games that are really love using them Call of Duty a particular the last two times that I really really really use shotguns was in  Ops 2 and in Modern Warfare 2 I remember using the camera what it was called, but it was the shotgun that had the rotating four barrels or the for magazines. So you would like dot dot Circle that that it's - that that's - but you would like change it. You know what your twists? Yeah, but that was really fun to use because the animation was cool. But also it was a very useful shotgun, but in particular Apex is the only game recently that I've used two shotguns anytime I see  A peacekeeper. I'm picking it up immediately because I know it's going to give me that advantage on the battlefield. Hmm, especially for if the circle starts going down and it looks like it's going towards some buildings. Hell. Yeah when a peacekeeper, but at the same time I also I also know what it's like to be on the receiving end and it can just be it can just be so frustrating. You know giggity. Yeah. Wait, how does that getting whatever being on the receiving end?  I mean other than let's sink classes. I mean I think Rafe is pretty balanced. I think caustic is I think caustic what they need to fix about him is obviously like you should not be impaired almost at all. If your Ally going through the cloud, but you are now granted part of that is because it's a cloud like for instance bangalore's smoke grenade, you know, you're pretty impaired if you're an ally going through that.  That but I think both of those let's say both of them both of those. I feel like they need to find some way because you don't want to make it Opie where it's like, oh, I just have X-ray vision, but you also don't want to make it so that like it's really bad, but I feel like caustic is way worse than Bangalore wouldn't you agree?  Oh, yeah. Yeah, for sure. Yeah for sure. I've seen a lot of know as far as Weapons go. I seen a lot of people complain about the triple take I haven't had a whole lot because me and you mostly were either going to pick up the lawn mowers G7 Scout. I've picked up the Triple take maybe once or twice and I was not good with it. So I never used it again. But I've seen a lot of people complain about the triple taking it of itself. So yeah, I think that I think that maybe the next patch we're going to see some weapon balancing, but what's going to be really  See how they handle the Peacekeeper. Yeah. Yeah. I kind of feel like they need to do something with it. Who knows what it I mean, especially if you get like the choke on it where you can charge it up or whatever even then it's like even like triple the damage or something. So then it's even more ridiculous. So I mean they need to do something with it. Other than that. I mean, I can't really think of too many other weapons where I feel like it's just like it stands out other than  Other than I mean the most on queef, I mean we can all agree that it's just a terrible weapon just absolutely terrible. That's the only other thing I would change would be the drops which we've already talked about before. Yeah. I mean, I feel like well, I feel like they can't exactly like make it do the can't exactly make it do like more damage because then if they buff it too much then it becomes Opie and we're talking about that but one thing somebody came up with is having like a legendary drops.  Where you can aqui aqui? No, is that what it's called a chemo like Mo akimbo where you can akimbo Mosin queefs and I feel like that would be a really cool solution as far as okay. I hate the most on queef. But if I can find that legendary attachment where I can have two of them, that'd be kind of cool. And I mean, that'd be like, you know rolling around would like to double barrel shotguns, you know, like in the movies, I feel like that'd be a really cool addition.  Now one thing that's interesting talking about shotguns is if you look at the spray patterns for the weapons like IGN has a on their Wiki for Apex Legends. They've got a graph that's got all the spray patterns for all the weapons. Look at this graph. Look at this get did you love that? I was dying. Okay. So anyway, the shotguns are the most interesting one. So if you look at the Peacekeeper it spray pattern is a completely even symmetrical star I mean,  It's insane. You look at the Eva Auto and surprise and kind of interestingly the spray pattern is in the shape of an 8. Hmm. It's kind of weird but is also symmetrical in the sad Mason as well. The Mastiff is asymmetrical line horizontal line. You look at the Mozambique the spray pattern on it is inconsistent completely. So it makes sense why Mozambique snotra great weapon to use especially out of those other shotguns. I mean who would have thought something short and stubby would have a weird spray powder?  Turn and that's a gig but but it's interesting to look and a lot of these you can kind of pretty much tell like as far as the other weapons the assault rifles and submachine guns. But that's what I found. The most interesting is the spray pattern on the Mozambique itself. It's like okay maybe fix for it could maybe make the grouping a little bit tighter. If you're going to have all the other shotguns in the game have a very tight grouping maybe fix that so  It's more of an even shot. Whenever you're using it. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, or make it more randomized rather than here's this pattern that goes out and you know, that pattern is always going to be there. Maybe make it slightly different each time. I mean, that'd be another another thing to kind of balance all the shotguns. Yeah, so that you don't know you don't know exactly where the pellets are going to go. Sometimes you're going to hit it just right. Sometimes you're going to have a couple pellets going to the left or something like that. So and I feel like correct me if I'm wrong with  wouldn't that be like a real shotgun or can you relatively predict a real shotguns pattern?  I mean kind of but in terms of gaming I've never seen a grouping as tight on the shotgun totally then on the Peacekeeper. I mean it is ridiculous how tight that grouping. Yes. Absolutely which just adds to its overpowered - because like, I mean it really at really close range, which is obviously the point but I really close range if you get it just right, you know, yeah, it's just you hit every single pellet and  So it can it can just it can bring the experience down sometimes.  I can agree 100% with that. All right, so that brings us to the end of the topic of the week. What are your thoughts? What are some changes and balances you would like to see in the game whether it be weapons abilities items we didn't even cover items, but maybe we'll do that on our bonus. What do you guys think? Let us know on apex Legends cast on Twitter or Apex Legends Hub cast at gmail.com?  Arm up next we're going to be doing our deep dive on Lifeline. Alright. So today's Deep dive going in order is now Lifeline Lifeline is your combat medic her passive ability revive knock down teammates faster while protected by a shield wall healing items also are used 25% faster. So this is really good lifelines tactical ability is Doc the healing drone call in.  Doc or drone of compassion to automatically heal nearby teammates over time and the ultimate ability is the care package call in a drop full of high quality defensive gear. So those are the basics of life line. Now, let's talk about tips and tricks of how to utilize Lifeline in the best ways possible. Let's start off with the passive ability. This one's the most obvious you revive people faster and you're protected.  Shield wall. So what are some things that you want to keep in mind number one is which way is The Shield wall facing. I've seen it so many times somebody come up to revive me, but there are unfortunately facing the wrong way and they end up dying anyway, so it's like well that Shield wall only works if you're pointing it in the direction of the enemies now as far as anybody can tell nothing can actually destroy the shield or if it can nobody's been able to  Troy it fast enough where the person isn't done Reviving. So this is really useful another tool in your toolbox to use is let's say you have a squad two people go down one is lifeline. And another is somebody else revive Lifeline first because then she will revive the other person twice as fast with protection and you can make sure to provide OverWatch. I've seen it so many times where somebody has revived the other person.  First rather than the life line and I myself have been caught in that trap always revive Lifeline first it will cut your time in half. And then the other part is healing items are used 25% faster. So this is a really good survival mechanic of Lifeline. So not only does she throw out the healing drone which we'll talk about in a little bit but just general items to heal herself are 25% faster. So when you're in the heat of battle and you want to get behind  some cover you're going to be able to heal yourself a lot faster than a normal person so that way if somebody does come to push you you can hopefully finish that medkit way faster. So then let's talk about the healing drone. Now the healing drone is stationary and it just hovers in one area. The area of effect is not that large so you have to stay pretty close but a good trick to think of is if you walk up against it you can move the Drone and so maybe if somebody's  Ending just outside of it and they don't realize it just kick it a little bit their way. It will heal all three members at the same time and it does pretty much the same amount as a medkit healing now. If you're in a situation where time is not a hindrance on you and you have some time to just breathe, you know, there's nobody around do a healing drone rather than waste a stim pack or a medkit the healing drone does just as good and can heal the entire Squad. So instead of wasting  eating healing items that you might need to In the Heat of battle do the healing drone if you have the capability to as long as you have cover one person can cover one way the other person can cover another way and at least then you're getting healed and when it comes down to it in the healing drone is starting to recharge then use a stim pack or a health pack do not ever use an item. If you don't absolutely have to especially with a lifeline on your team, then there's the big mother of all  Care packages now obviously, there are supply drops throughout the map and they are marked by little pulsating circles. The blue circles that you might see on your map. These are supply drops care package is pretty much a supply drop, but you get to decide where to drop it and the more times you drop a care package the more likely it is to have a gold gun in it or some orange armor. Just making it one of the best ultimates and also let's just  Face it ultimate accelerators pop them like candies because you want your care packages to come as quickly as possible. If you have a lifeline on your team and you're not using accelerants then what the heck are you doing? There's one match. We're going to go into storytime really quick here. There is this one match to Ultimate accelerants in a death box. I of course ping them because I have a life line on my team then one of my other teammates drops an Ultimate Accelerate, so of course both of us,  Ping that item the lifeline unfortunately didn't understand what an ultimate accelerant does so as nicely as possible through the mic and I don't think they were listening but as nicely as possible through the mic. I tried to explain that it ultimate accelerant accelerates your ultimate and by leaving them behind you just gave up 60% of your ultimate. Please do not be this person rant over.  / Lifeline might be one of the more easy characters with far less nuances to her character. She is pretty straightforward. So if you're a beginning character, this might be a good character to go with even the last two characters. We spoke a little bit more about tips and tricks. This one's pretty straightforward. But those are things you should probably keep in mind so that you can be the best lifeline you can so that's everything you need to know to be a good life line. So let's move on to coaching champions.  All right coaching Champions is our tips and tricks. This is where you can write in with your own tips and tricks and make it onto the show just like Isaac did apparently you got back from space and started playing some Apex. It's even Isaac see like that's the he see he seen some yeah, he's seen some some  All right. I have a helpful tip / strategy in in-game or if you are being chased at any time pretty much every building has crates or Ledges on the walls that you can get on top of. So if you are getting chased and run into a building climb on top of such an object and immediately you have an advantage to see the enemy when they don't see you. No one runs into a single story building and looks up try it.  Almost every time I have done this I can get an easy shot off and then shot off on an advancing enemy unaware of where I went please share if you find helpful, so that's a pretty good one as far as like you can see so many especially in the bunker or whatever, but if you think about it what he's talking about not specifically in the bunker, but just any building has some type of crates to get up on top of and so yeah, I feel like that's a that's a pretty good one.  And Isaac, if you want to write in what console you're on all you gave us was your username and that you're a console player, but you didn't tell us what console you're on. So right back in with what console you're on and we will gladly share your username are the next one comes from Matt s it says, hey Nick an 8-bit listening to your podcast. It's day one really enjoy them on my commute to and from work. Thank you for that. Thank you for that response that was confused when you guys were way.  When you guys were talking about sliding today you missed a cool feature my tip for you guys is that when you are in a sliding animation, you can pull out consumable heels or ultimate accelerants. This is very useful when you're running from a storm or an enemy and just need to maintain movement while also getting off a quick enough. Not sure if you're able to include this in your next podcast, but I did just begin streaming on Twitch. I play kind of casually and don't have very many followers. But if you wouldn't mind giving my channel a shout-out, I would extremely appreciate it.  Absolutely. His channel is Maddie nuts on twitch.tv. So that's M A TTY nuts on Twitch. That is Matt. That is a great tip. That's something that I haven't really paid attention to I if you remember me talking about sliding, I just remember just remembered after playing a few games. Oh, yeah, I can do this. So that's another thing that I'm learning is. Hey you could also do and that's a great mechanic to if you're needing to run and get away. Go ahead and he lit the same time that way you don't have to stop.  You running and then he'll did you see the one where you could self revive midair?  I didn't I did see the thing where if you use an ability right before you go down like if you use your like if you do a shield recharge right before you go down you'll have your gun out. So that's probably a glitch. Oh, yeah, that's probably something they'll patch out real soon. But yeah the self revive the guy like goes off of a cliff and then self revised as he's in the air. He stops mid fall and he does the whole animation. I think that's something like take advantage of that, right?  Now if you if you haven't already because I'm pretty sure they'll patch that out real quick. So Tom would like to teach you guys about some etiquette for instance. If someone gets a kill and another teammate that had nothing to do with said kill come and start looting the box that is definitely something that I've noticed and I've actually caught myself doing is like I actually happen like but you know, what would fix that?  At Mike's not just kidding. Not everybody uses mics. But however, just try to if you do have a mic or something. Just try to be like hey, do you need this? Do you need that? And a really good tip? I think for everybody would be is that once you have your Loadout lockdown? You're like, okay. I have the G7 Scout and I have the prowler for instance. What I would do just as a try to get used to doing it on a regular.  If you press start and you hover over the G7 you can ping it and you'll say I need light ammo you can go over and you can go over the prowler and you can do that and I need heavy ammo and so hopefully you can also do that for the attachments as well. But hopefully if the people are listening you can kind of just give them a heads up if this is what I always need this is, you know something to look out for me and hopefully if they're paying attention, they'll make sure to let you know if they see it in  in a loop box  Now one thing that I have done because I'm a guy I'm you know, I'm bad about this too and someone will get a kill and I'll run over to the box but something that I do is I'll go through the box about how does anyone need a smoke there's a scope here so you can I think you can do that, but don't be that dick where you're like, oh, I'm gonna take everything up to make sure we look at this. Yes. I try to be as conservative as possible. If I happen to notice that both of us are looking down at it because another thing to keep in mind, is that when  Everybody's looking down at the Box. Nobody's looking at if anybody's coming up on you.  Right and I've done that before too you guys like I remember there's a couple times we've played and you guys were looking around there's like other's enemies and I'm still losing it just a second. Yeah, hold on one second. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Damn. All right, this next one comes from Curt. H-hey guys episode 2 was great. It's a pretty resourceful content given for all skill levels. Have you had a chance to try out the new Havoc gun yet. The thing is pretty.  Badass especially equipped with a Turbocharger to answer your question. No, I haven\",\n",
              "   \" the number 25  I've it's definitely enticing but  That would be my one and only reason to get the 25 verses the just regular battle pass, you know what I mean? So for me personally, I don't know. I don't know because I mean I guess on the other hand you do have a legendary Apex pack at five. You have another regular Apex at 1200 yet coins and I think that first one is for a hundred coins. Yeah, it's 400 points. So then you  More coins that I'd be a hundred fifty coins, then you finally get one more Apex packs plus costing. You know what I'm going to say. Yeah. I'm going to say that's actually pretty worth it.  Because I mean like if we go by their metrics, which we're not going to get into that because we don't agree with their metrics, but if we do go by their metrics he is $18 by himself and then you get the $1 with the Apex pack you get the 150 with the coins you get another dollar with the other Apex pack and then another $18.  Because of the Spitfire legendary Escape our legendary skin and then you also have a legendary we keep calling it legendary, isn't it epic? Which one? Yes.  What's the Epic purple one called then?  Oh, oh, I've been mixing them up then. So then you have the F out of it that epic. You have the Epic Apex thing on level 5 so that right there already like doubles its value. So I would say yeah, you know the first season no, I'm not spending $25 you effing crazy screw that but this season. Yeah, it actually like it definitely has its value and I think that from season one like we're going to get maybe a little nip  In a little bit, but just from a very positive standpoint the difference between one and two as far as value as far as what they did put in it how they spread it out is just night and day like if this would have been season 1 I to a certain extent if this would have been season 1 I really feel like they would have retained more people. What do you think? Oh, yeah. I definitely think so, like right this this this battle pass isn't perfect, but it's such an upgrade from  What we had in season one that and also like if this was the season that we got like four season one, I would have been like, okay first good first. Try good first try like there's there's some good stuff in here for sure. Whereas the the one that we actually got four season one was like, all right. I kind of see where you're going. This is like games first battle pass, you know, like actually it's kind of any kind of give them a pass a little bit. But no, this is really give him a pass on their battle pass on the Baton Pass there.  Actually, there's nothing really in this battle pass that I don't care for which we'll get into kind of the deeper of because me and you have a differing opinion. I know that let's just get deep into it. Well, I'm teasing it for so long. Let's just get deep. Let's get deep. Look at what you okay. So I have both positive and negatives for the rare skins. So the rare skins would be all the gun skins which are very similar to season one basically like  Every Let's see. We got one at three one at six one at 13. So it's roughly every three to six you get a new skin for a new gun. So the positive let's start we'll start with the negative. The negative is they're not awesome. You know, there are some that are there not necessarily reskinned like like last time last season there were essentially three  Skins but they just redid them on different guns. Now there are some ones that are different but they're not different enough to really be like, okay, that's a brand-new skin. It's just like this is the molten one, but it's slightly different. So that's my negative. And it honestly it's not even that big of a negative. So then my positive is that it is not the same three skins over and ago a little over and over again. So for instance number three, which is  Obviously one of the first rares you're going to get it's got a nice little scaly system to it's got some red on it. And then the next one after that. It has kind of a molten on the P 2020 which I mean who you're trying to who try to fools and then the next one would be the 13 in it sort of is the same as the prowler.  But it's not the exact same so then if you go through and try to find another one that looks like the prowler and the Longbow you don't so it's just those two and then it moves the F on you know what I mean? And so that's that's kind of my positive right there that they do repeat it in a way, but they don't repeat it for every single gun. So it's still it makes you feel like  You're still getting something new and I'd have to say that that's a big positive especially over season one because yes, I get one that's for the you know Mozart queef and you have to do or whatever but then I get that similar-looking one on the flat line and I'm like, okay, but it's still subtly enough different looking on the flat line, then it's like okay. It is a new skin.  Yeah, like they're not there. They're similar more than anything. They're not the same design but there's similar like for example and 23 you get the G7 Scouts can the Cyclone it kind of looks like snake scales kind of yeah, definitely and then you go over to let's see where it's at you go over to 46, which is the alternator skin. It's called battle class that has a zip similar design aesthetic, but it's not one for one exactly now, so that's that's what you're saying. Like they look similar, but they're not the exact same thing.  I think is definitely a big bonus like you're saying but like I think the my favorite one that's just a rare would probably be 66 the hemlock the thing it's called Mainframe and it looks like very industrial and really cool and honestly the Mozambique skin. I like I like I like it like it'sit's cool like the one for the flight line is similar, but like I like that very African aesthetic death like on the Mozambique which is  obviously fitting and it looks cool on it. They know I don't see I still don't know if I'm going to pick up them the Mozambique but yeah, so this get like it's definitely an upgrade. That's that's something we can save sure. It's definitely an upgrade. Yeah, because I think that was the biggest like fu is that like we were getting like let's say 40 skins or something in the last battle pass, but it was just the same one over and over again. So the one that looked like an Indian like  Blanket or something, you know, you know the one I'm talking about. Yeah, there is one that looked like a map and then one that looked like yeah, like I weaved blanket exactly. So the one that looks like a weave blanket, you just got that same one, but now it's on the P20 now, it's on the most Mozambique now, it's on the Longbow now, you know what I mean? So having different ones throughout the entire past is good and then you get to 96 and you have that one that's like zombies or something on the wingman and I'm like hell yeah.  Yeah, like this is the part of the battle pass that I'm like, oh they kind of learn their lesson and that's really cool. But and here's the part that it's all about positioning and it's all about marketing and the way they positioned this I felt was slightly misleading not too bad because now The Trackers you do still get trackers like season one kills season or season 2 kills season 2 wins, so they still  Have that but they're along with something. So they almost don't even count because it's like you're getting that at the same time you're getting something else. So not not super huge. But the way they positioned it was very much like, you know, those trackers that you didn't care about. Well, we're going to put something in there that you actually do care about and then what do we get? We get loading screens in music, which the music You could argue is pretty much just like the quips that nobody.  Heard about but now it's music and so like especially the pre hype for this was very much like, oh they're learning their lesson there listening to the fan as a whatever but then they just do loading screens and music and you know, this is definitely something I want the community to talk to me about and I want to know like what do you guys think about that? Because me and Nate actually have a differing opinion about the loading screen. Whereas like me. It's like I don't give a rat's ass. Why do I care?  About what it looks like when my game is loading. The loading screen is just me waiting to play the game. Why do I care about?  Hey guys, let me tell you about a bite-sized pondcast. If you're an avid gamer, then the lore party of video game podcast is the show for you with more than 100 episodes covering over 25 different games and franchises. The rotating hosts Focus entirely on the story's characters and universe of their favorite games listeners can expect to hear topics ranging from lgbtq representation in  Series secret Pokemon Wars and the source of handsome Jack's Insanity in the Borderlands games. You can join the conversation by following the lore party of video game podcast on Spotify. What what's there when it's loading right? So where my opinion comes in? I'm not going to say your opinion is wrong, but it's wrong. No. No, I'm just kidding. I'm not that type of person. It's your opinion where for me  for one  For me for one the art on these is incredible. I guess there's there's there's a couple in particular that are very standout one and you actually get early on Gibraltars that one would it's like that that thes or like the shield like popping out the art and the design of it looks incredible. I see I really like them but here's the thing. Here's the caveat that I have there. Mmm. I remember it. This one's very similar to Fortnight as well. You get different loading screens, but I think for those you got those  For winning challenges. I don't know never mind. They were in the tier challenges that they were they were in the tear that that's what it was. Yeah, so that's the thing the ones in Fortnight. I always liked getting because I liked having the change of screen. I did like that but there were always just not what I wanted like, I guess just because I'm not a big fan of the character design. Anyway, I'm the world. I'm like, oh, this is cool to change it out. Whereas these  What would be cool is if they give you the option to have these as well wallpapers to like I know that's very meta and it's not you know what I'm saying, but it would be cool. If you had the options to save these as wallpapers because these this art is really really good like on a lot of some of these we've already seen like the Mirage and the race skin or sorry The Wraith art we've seen both of those like already but some of these I haven't seen before so like the the both Honda one I haven't seen before.  Or but I like them I will definitely take these over stat trackers just because true I like having a I like having stat trackers in one place like go. Let me go to my profile and let me look at my stats. I don't care to have them on my banners. You know what I'm saying? Yeah true. So I mean as far as instead of trackers, yeah, I guess this is a step up but at the same time, like I said, it's all about positioning and they position this like this is going to be something you actually care about.  Out and it's like I don't personally care about it. There are gonna be people in the community that do care about it, but it's like this is going to be horrible. Here we go. Horrible story time for you. Okay. So my wife got something from Amazon and she's like, you know like oh, yeah, I got you something. I got you something. She has a smile on her face and I'm like, you know, and so it was like it was like a couple of days before it was gonna arrive and I'm like  No, okay. So just so that I don't you know expect something too much. Like is it going to be something that I actually like and she's like, oh, yeah, it's going to be something you actually like so then it gets here and it's a shirt not that I hate The Shirt By Any Means whatsoever. But when you tell me that I'm actually going to like it and then it's just a shirt. It's like babe. Yeah, it could it could be like, maybe it's maybe it's a tool for my dice que. No, maybe it's something that I can use.  Yeah positioning that's a very good argument. Exactly and it's just the way she said it was like oh, yeah, you're really gonna like it now in her defense the shirt was Dad. I love you 3,000 it was it was a late Father's Day present for me. So it's like I do like the shirt but when she positioned it as oh, yeah, you're actually going to like this, you know, it just would have been better if she would have sent might expect Sensations like oh you're gonna like it, but it's nothing like extravagant if she would have said,  Something along those lines it would have been great. Same thing with this if they would have said, oh you guys are going to like this. It's going to be something different or whatever if they would have stuck with that kind of position. So it's something different. It's not something Monumental but when they basically outright said this is going to be people something that people actually care about rather than just trackers it set my expectations. And so that can sometimes be the worst thing or whatever, you know, objectively this isn't bad. It's not  Horrible, it's not egregious in any way, but it's just enough to make me go. I don't really care about it. What do you feel about the drop animations? So that's the only negative I have I like them. I think they're I think they're cool. I think they're the same thing with the loading screens. I think it's a it's a it's a better use than stat trackers. But again this goes back to a complaint that I've had before about the difference in their skin systems and how instead of universal unlocks it.  It's character or weapon specific. I don't necessarily care for the fact that their character specific emotes like I would much prefer and granted their animated to be like that character, but I would have much preferred. This is very small, but I would have much preferred like just Universal emotes anyone can use and there's some that are really cool. Like I like Pathfinders and I like octane's I think they're really putting he does is running. I think they're really clever but again like  Like, you know, if you're going to play as these characters of these are your Mains awesome great, but like it'd be cool to have a universal emote to use throughout no matter which character you pick. You know what I'm saying? That's the only con that I have with it. And it's it's you know, this is the first time they're getting they're putting emotes in for my understanding, you know, all the other Battle Royale games have like emotes and their Contraband streams or there, you know battle pass dreams. So it's definitely this is a good first attempt. But yeah,  You know, I just I don't know if they're ever going to change that to make it a universal skin or emote platform. I don't know. That's the only thing that I don't like and I don't want to sound too begrudging on it, but it's just it's a very simple thing, you know, it does make it stand out that it's not like every other game but at the same time, it's like it'd just be nice to use that one skin or that one thing across different things instead of having to go through different a band Avenues to unlock, you know something that I can get on everything, you know.  Yeah, even if they would have done something like maybe the unlocked it for like three characters. I think maybe something like that would have been a multi-character instead of just a single character. And I mean, I think that I agree with pretty much everything you say like octane is obviously the best and each one does have subtle personality quirks, but at the same time like for instance if you never play as octane, maybe you just don't prefer him then getting his cute little  Well, you know animation you're not really going to care about so then that brings us back to the holes like oh it's going to be things you actually care about or whatever. It's like it is but only for the characters I play as you know, so like if I actually play as both whole know which I do on a regular basis like oh here's this Banner. It looks kind of cool going to be honest. I already have one. That's like way more awesome. So it's like when I get to 48 and it does that Ding and it flashes for me, I'm gonna be like Yay, but yeah.  Want to go ahead is so much better than season one. Yeah, honestly the going into the banners. That's something I really do like like the the rare banners or cool. Like there's not really any of them that like super stand out to me. But the Epic ones that's where it's at That's Sports. Oh, yeah 68 bangalore's that one is really good. Really really good finder. Yes. He has that little sword with the smile.  On it. Yeah Pathfinder's is great. And then you've got your bra Alters is really good to the coat of arms. Like if you're that's a 98 98. Oh, yeah. That one looks cool, too. Yeah. So those does Epic winter very good. What's that? You got a little Falcon buddy. You got a little Falcon Buddy Guy, but yeah, like I think the music is cool too. It's I like the I will take that over the  Season one. Let's go. There was the same cookie cutter dumb. She's a woman. Let's get into it. Hahaha. Oh my God. Yes, I will agree with that 100% that you know in general in general. This is a step up and I do have to say like if this would have been season one or even just a sliver of this would have been Ste. Someone like there would have been a completely different look and one of the biggest things I don't know about you but one of the biggest things is  Is the scrap giving us a hundred and twenty scrap it? What is it? Let's see. That's a first one at 9 then another 119 another one every 10. Well, yeah, whenever every time yeah every 10 you get it and that's like something to work towards because not only are you getting the Apex coins? And so basically every two times you get any pics Point. Boom you get an egg picks, you know, bot or whatever the hell you call but then  Um, you get the scrap and it's like I already have like I think right now I have about like 300 saved up. So it's like I by the end of this I'm already getting enough scrap to get a legendary, but I don't actually personally have to finish it before I have enough, right? So yeah, really awesome. Yeah. No, I don't think that's the thing is depending on how much scrap you already have. Like that's the only thing that would be kind of unfortunate is you know, your typical legendary is going to it's going to take 1,200 scrap.  Don't think you're not getting I don't think you're going to get 1,200 scrap throughout the battle pass he know but if you know, oh you are gonna get 12 year. Yeah, you got you get 120 for each scrap and you get 10 scraps. Okay. Solid Point math is not my strong suit. So there you go. You got a good point there. But yeah that that that is nice and I always like when systems do that like I haven't I don't think I've talked about it on here, but I have on other podcast that I've completely stopped playing Black Ops for completely I know.  Late and I've gone back to infinite Warfare which was Infinity Ward's still hate the naming convention Infinity Ward's Last Call of Duty, but they're quartermaster their supply drops system. I like a lot better because no matter if I get a duplicate I'll get scrapped for it. Whereas I don't think that's the same system are all gets re Salvage I'll get Salvage and so it's the same thing with the scrap you can use it for certain things. But if I get a duplicate,  I'll get that and like every pack will give me something it like it'll give me three items plus Salvage and so it's nice because I already I've apparently when I first got this game in 2016. I played one round of multiplayer and said I was done because when I jumped back o\",\n",
              "   \" it's okay and it's like, oh, yeah, it's fine. You know, like if your nonchalant about it.  You know like okay then great. I'm glad you like it. I want to know anybody out there who genuinely genuinely like, oh my God, this is everything I ever wanted, you know all the speculation leading up to it all the hype surrounding it. Is it what you wanted, you know, and once again, it's not to condescend you it's not to belittle you we genuinely would like to know if it is something that you enjoy. Yeah. I don't know if it sounded belittling. I didn't really mean for it to boil.  Help that you were yelling it now like genuinely. We do want to know what your thoughts are on this battle past. Like I said at the beginning the consensus from what I've seen on Reddit and everywhere else on the internet, like a lot of people aren't happy with this but I really do want a good reason. Why you think this is a good is this is good about a past like like I said, like I said again and I'm going to say it over and over again if it was more variety in skins. I think that would be I think that would soften the blow a lot but the fact that it's just the same three scans and are transitioning from different guns.  Means that I'm not going to use half of the guns that are on this list. I mean in rotation, I'll use the Longbow sometimes preferably. I'll use the G7 Scout and where is the g spot? Where is this going for the G7 Scout on this anyway, I don't know somewhere way down somewhere. Yeah, it's 94 94 like all the guns that are at the top except for maybe I mean the Spitfire I use and the prowler I use so pretty low one last thing I'd like to do.  For comparison sake is to talk about the different things. They had for season 2 for 4 tonight, and we're not going to count the ones that are just reskin. So the obviously you have the blue Squire and the Royal Knight and the Black Knight. Those are basically just re skins of each other and so I'm not going to count those but I'm going to what I'm trying to point out is the variety so we have three skins for the battle pass, right?  Right, but it's just different guns. Then we have the legendary skin that makes it for correct. Then we have the extra skin, which makes it five correct? Mmm. And any other skins, I mean, you have the banners which are kind of like we could equate those two like dances and stuff and for night, which is our cool. It's just it's just filler is my point. There's plenty of filler in season two as well. Okay, so that was a total of five. Correct, correct? Okay, so we got the black Squire we  The pulse acts we have the get down. We have the sir glider the Brave the Excalibur the Royal X the sparkle specialist and AC/DC. Do we want to count the backpack? Because that is like something they added. I mean, I personally enjoy the backpacks and season two like the shields are really cool, right?  But I'm just saying if we count that it technically beats Apex if it if we don't count it. It's technically the same it has the same amount as season 2 of fortnight, you know, I mean, the only thing is and I mean this is very technical or whatever. But the only thing is is that the reason why it kind of upsets me is that even a blue Rarity still I mean look at it. It's a night. It's a night.  Doesn't look anything like the default skin versus a blue Rarity in and that's why I like near the beginning of the show. I said they kind of screwed up by doing the Rarity system like they did because they blew Rarity and Fortnight looks completely different than the deep fry skin rather than you know, because you got your blond white guy you got your black guy. You got your Asian guy black girl a white girl and I want to say is there an Asian girl? So yeah, there's an Asian girl too. So  Instead of instead of the blue being a tie-dye version of white guy. It is a freaking night. So I was like 40 minutes of bitching about the Battle pass, you know, and if you're still here and there is a part of you that maybe is just kind of like, you know, these guys just you know wind and bitch these guys are your Jim Sterling these guys are your clean prints gaming where all you do is talk about negative stuff liveing.  Genuinely do apologize because that isn't us we are usually I mean especially Nate. I mean the fact that I got Nate on board like there's a part of me that just loves that and just take so much. Oh so much pleasure in that but at the same time even Nate is usually the hype Guy usually Nate is the corporate apologist which you know, not in a bad way obviously, but it's nice because Nate usually contradicts what I say and so we have this back and forth.  And that's usually how it goes, you know, we disagree on a lot of stuff, but unfortunately we happen to agree but it's in a negative way and if you don't like us being negative, I want you to know that neither do we I can put up a really good front and I can go on these Rants and everything but in general I am a pretty positive guy. I'm the guy who came up with Nick and Nate jingle. You know, where is like Nick it Nate kind of just looks at me. Like why are you why are you  Stupid you know? Yeah, but I mean that is just who we are. We're very positive guys and we try to look at everything in positive ways as we can and you cross us on the street. We're not going to say FU. We're just going to be like, hey, dude, what's up, you know and that's just the kind of people we are and how you doing, huh? Yeah, that's just the kind of people we are. So if you don't like us being this- it's it's the feeling's mutual. I do not I don't like being this negative, you know, and in fact, there's actually a  out of me and it's silly I know but there is a part of me that almost, you know, almost feels weird about having to be this negative or be this contrarian about something that's essentially free free to play. You know, it's like well is anybody even really care I mean obviously read it does credit card but still like there is just this small part of me is like, you know and my making am I making too much out of this, you know, my am I putting too much into this and I really should just be  Happy in general, you know and like there's definitely a part of me that thinks of this but then I just look at how much grinding I would have to do. I look at my beautiful baby daughter and I'm like, you know what? I think I want to see her in the next 90 days. So, you know, that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to focus on that and you know that 950 respawn you can have that you can have that and thanks for giving us content, you know. Thanks for helping us build this community.  Now that we have on Discord, you can check it out in the description down below or you can it'll it's always pinned to whatever our top thing is on Twitter at Apex Legends cast you can go there. You can join the community the amount of support the amount of people that come to us and just say how much they loved the show. It means so much to me, you know, so briefs pain you can take that 950 and that's that's your payment for giving us this giving us this chance to you know,  Our God giving us this chance to just you know put ourselves out there and I mean, I can't be more happy that because I mean we've been we've been trying for so long and we've been at this for a while now and you know respawn gave us that opportunity in a way, you know, and maybe not directly indirectly whatever but it happened, you know, and so, you know, thank you for that and if I can end that this show on that positive note, I would love to because you know respawn has technically given  Nah, something even though we might be upset with it. Now. It is something that we do still like and it is something that has hopefully forever changed us, you know, if we look back, you know five years from now and we're maybe doing this a little bit more full-time or we're doing this even just part time, you know and are able to do something that we absolutely love to do. We love to make content for you guys. We love to give our opinions, you know, we add the little songs in and we make it our own and we make it this  Product that we're proud of you know, and if we can look back five years from now and now we're starting to do it more full time. We're able to start making some money off and make some really good content. You know, maybe we got some new equipment and everything. We got our patreon supporters there. We got Adam. I'm not gay I'm Kevin we got math cop and we got our boy Danny's, you know, and I mean, that's just the start that's just the start of the year and hopefully new 2019 is going to be great, you know, and we look back.  Back, we look back. And what was this all what did this all start with technically vermintide to but let's not go there it technically started with respawn and it really started to blow up, you know, and it blew up with this in particular. So let's leave it on that high note. Let's leave it on, you know think you respawn. Thanks for making the game. You know, we're not always we're not always going to see eye-to-eye. There's going to be some stuff that maybe we're not happy about maybe it's like hey you need to fix this you need to fix this but in general  We really like Apex Legends and we're going to keep coming back to it on a regular basis. Whether it be for the new content, whether it be for the new, you know, characters and stuff and the weapons and everything. And you know, we're going to we're going to keep coming back. So anything that I get knocked down but I get up again. I'm never gonna hit man out. No, I mean that's you put it perfectly. There's nothing really I can add to that. I mean, of course I can I can just pair it what he said, but I say, we really do appreciate everything you guys are doing.  That everything you guys have done and are doing I mean it's like he was saying we've been at this for a while and for for the start of it. We didn't really have a whole lot of interaction with anybody. It was just us and you know, we would just totally fine. But the fact of especially when you're podcasting and you're doing something that you love when you get that immediate feedback when you get that responses that you've been looking for years for it means the world. I mean, it's it's it's something that you can't really describe it something you can only experience. So that's that's that's  Things that you have given to us respond and the people who watch and listen to the show. Absolutely. Absolutely. Alright guys, so thank you so much.
