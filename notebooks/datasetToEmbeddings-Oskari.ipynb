              " \"Hi everyone, and welcome to murder friends the podcast were three friends from three different countries talk about murder. My name is Alana and I'm Canadian. Hi, I'm Anna and I'm American. My name is Hannah and I'm British. So sit back and relax you're among friends. And let's talk murder. Now. Today's episode is really special because it is the conclusion of spooky month. Which in my opinion is probably the best month. You're right. I love Halloween is the best time of year. For the whole month, really? Yes spooky season. It's pretty great. I mean in general you could start wearing sweaters boots, you know, go completely black and goth and coffee. Yeah spice lattes if that's your sort of basic thing, you know, which is because it is and if you're a more murdery, no than its quad gourd season. Yeah, exactly. The only thing that I've noticed so I've been living in England for just a couple of years. And England doesn't do Halloween like North America does which is kind of a bummer, but I guess I just sort of get used to it. Where is like in Canada? It feels like everything is draped in fake cobwebs from like October 5th and on like the stores go all out all the houses go all out costumes go all out. We're here in England. Not that so much of a popular thing. Now, it's I noticed that too because I'm America as well. It's insane. Like people go nuts for Halloween. It's a big thing. I mean nobody costume people decorate their whole house. I mean some go even more nuts than Christmas with the whole house decorating. I mean, it's a massive massive thing and every house participates like here you might get obviously I have a little one so I have been trick-or-treating here with her and you might get like two houses on the street. It's just it's pretty pathetic but  But it's only because you guys don't do it. Yeah, I was never really like a thing when I was a kid. I mean it really bad Halloween, but we never went trick-or-treating we didn't do like costumes that much there were like the occasional Halloween party. But like that was a yeah, but I think that's mainly because we don't a bigger event in the UK is probably Guy Fawkes Night. Yeah, and it's so full of November. Yes, I bonfire night which is I think more of our like traditionally  British thing today. Yes, you do firework doesn't everything you don't think we set things on fire. So we do that more in Fourth of July. Yeah. I just remember like growing up in Canada Halloween you get your costume ready? Like two months in advance. So shout out to know you're like you're literally talking about it. Aren't you like for with your friends? Oh, yeah who can come up with the best costume? Yes, and then you all go to Value Village. Shout out to Value Village anybody who lived loves Value Village they are  Like a charity shop, but they go full out on Halloween because everybody goes there to buy their costume. So like you by bits and pieces and whatever so you go to Value Village. I remember one year. I must have been I want to say like nine and I was a mad scientist for Halloween true story. I'll have to dig up a picture and my mom was so good at costumes. We got this white lab coat and then ping pong balls. We like glued all over and Drew like little eyeballs on them.  And then I got like a one of the you know, like the dollar store has like a packet of plastic bugs so glued plastic bags all over I had a giant like plastic rat that we like so to my shoulder and then my mom in her absolute Grace and wisdom because it is a Halloween in Canada and it's fucking cold. She built this hat. Basically that was pink sort of like Shivani material that she  She sewed and wrapped up and put it onto a hat. So it looked like an exposed. Brain. Oh my God. Yeah, I'm not kidding and buy things like oh, so it's like a it looks really fucking cool. You're a mad scientist with an exposed brain and be your warm as hell because it's an actual hat and it's Halloween in Canada. So it might be snowing. I just like that is Halloween next to buying and a Ouija board from Zellers and then like doing the basement and like getting everybody.  Is that to me is like the perfect Halloween?  That's so funny that you mentioned about because you do have to factor in that you have to be warm because it's cold. So where I grew up in the DC area and it was cold. So you have to fact that you have your costume, but you have to work in how to get a jacket or like yeah thermals underneath it. So yeah take that into account. A lot of times you'd like by if you were buying costume at least you have to buy like a size too big so you can get your coat on underneath but then complain because it's like well, I want to be like a sexy  Cheerleader but I Gotta Wear My snowsuit on underneath this costume exactly exactly, but it was always I think more now they may call you get like the cheap Chinese with not Chinese, but I guess they made in China. They're made somewhere in a factory where they Mass produce like, you know, just the cheap costumes that you can buy where I love the the generic names on those. Oh, yeah, you're it's like wizard boy and this one. Yeah, exactly clearly a Harry Potter costume or something and do not stand close to an open flame because that now  they're definitely not claiming tried. I think they had to like legally start making them like whether like, you know, you're not just gonna immediately burst into flames like a child like you go near a feat only composed. Yeah, baby. I know back when I was younger to we made a lot of costumes that's like a big deal was to make them more so and that brings me to one of the things one of my costumes and I was desperately trying to find a picture right before we started and I'm gonna find it post it on the socials but one year.  Cited and this is the most non-scary geekiest thing ever, but I don't know why I've insisted I wanted to go as an artist. So I just wore this outfit where I made myself one of those  What are they called? Like I had a beret I have like this whole outfit with oh, do you have got a little bored? I'm bored. What are those things the palette palette and a paintbrush a carrier out and that and I just walk because I was like, I don't know but it was just and in that picture I have on white sweatpants and sweat shirt underneath the stuff because you know how you're trying again. You're trying to make yourself as warm as possible. So you have to like layer up. What kind of age are we talking here? Oh, I was like ten I mean and then nobody knew what I was.  Okay, let me know. What kid goes as an artist for Halloween. Like what a loser. I think between that and wanting to be an M&M one year, but that was like yeah, do you mean the kind of Eminem? I was a green one to be exact. Okay, but it was like I think you can probably buy the generic costumes now, but like what we live full on made it with like felt felt was your best friend Allie?  Queen oh, yeah, I remember one year. I it was a Value Village costume. We when I was a cheerleader like the most unsexy looking cheerleader, but I wanted to be a dead cheerleader because I thought I would be okay cool. So I bought a bunch of fake blood and you can get those it's almost I don't know what the material is but you put it on your face and spread it out and it looks like skin. It's disgusting and I need to cover my face in. Yeah, just not nice.  That was like a homemade Value Village. Let's not do a cheerleader. Let's do a dead cheerleader and it was disgusting like 13, right? That's cool. Yeah, but I just knowing you you're so not a chick like you're just like the opposite of like cheerleader, but then you say dead cheerleader and okay, that's definitely more you but then I think obviously Hannah you didn't do the trick or treating stuff. But I feel like you make it up. You've been making it up and your later adult life, but just by being a golf. Yeah exactly.  Really? You're like Halloween every day. You're not wrong. So, thanks.  So for this episode we were talking about what we wanted to do for spooky month and I think it was like this time last year maybe when we went camping maybe like late September. So the three of us went camping in Rye here in England and it was I don't know it was dark out. We all set out by our little homemade fire and we told murder mystery stories. So each of us told the story. It was super creepy. I'm sure everybody who was  Also camping was equally terrified because I'm pretty sure like our voices carry through that whole Campground, but I kind of wanted to do something similar where we gather around our virtual fire outside its spooky month and we're each going to tell a spooky murder mystery.  Normally here at murder friends. We tend to have fairly light episodes. Nothing to To Grim. I'd like to think a little bit a little bit lighter, but this is a different episode. So if you're not interested in really creepy fairly gruesome crimes, please go ahead and listen to one of our other episodes. This is just a special one-time thing. All of our episodes will not be this Grim. I promise.  I did some research on creepy stories. There's a couple that come to mind but none of them were really fitting and I found this one that I sort of did a little bit of a deep dive on and I yeah, you'll see why I chose it. So to set the scene imagine you're living at your family farm. It's beautiful Farm out in the in the woods your beloved maid quits because she keeps  Hearing strange noises in the house. That sucks not the end of the world but a bit creepy then you start finding newspapers in the house that no one in the family bought their actually from a city that's quite far away which nobody's travel to the house keys. Keep going missing. You see fresh footprints in the snow coming from the Dark Forest towards your farm leading to a broken door in the Farms machine room, but there are no tracks away from the  House, so the house on fire pretty much this guy. So this is the beginning of the infamous and I'm so sorry to all to German listeners hit hit enter. Now, I'm going to post it. I can't say I'm so sorry, but it is the story of the murders that happen at this Farmstead in 1922. So we got we're going back in time to a spooky.  Mystery out in Germany. So this is just a tiny small farm set about 70 kilometres north of Munich. It's one of the most gruesome and puzzling unsolved crimes in German history and it gave me nightmares. So on the evening of March thirty first nineteen twenty to six inhabitants of the farm were killed with a mattock which is like a pickaxe basically so the six victims  were the parents and dries and Seville again, so sorry for the names their Widow Widow daughter Victoria who was in her 30s and then Victoria's children who were seven and two and their new maid Maria. So like I mentioned some weird stuff started to happen before the attack so finding newspapers finding tracks to the house, but not out of the house the original  You'd quit. They was creepy noises in the night the family heard Footsteps in the Attic, but the father found nobody when he was searching the building. So overall 100% nightmare fuel creepy time. You do wonder which I'm sure I'll get to how do you kill six different people there? It's noisy or they going to be somebody's gonna wake up and then rot. I mean, it's just it seems insane. It's so it's so creepy. Anyway, okay, so  the father actually told several people about these observations, but he basically refused to accept help the details went unreported to the police. He was basically like I'm going to deal with it. It's not a big deal. No worries the family also reported seeing a man with a mustache. That's the only description we have a man with a mustache standing at the forage forests Edge and just staring at the house basically like watching them. Oh fuck creepy.  Also, I mean, it's a free country. I guess you can look wherever you want to look. So on the afternoon of the 31st the new maid Maria arrived. So Maria's sister a squirter her there and then left the farm shortly afterwards the sisters likely the last person to see everyone alive. So she literally drops off her sister at her new job. And then that's it. Basically the police believe that in the evening the sort of eldest daughter.  Victoria her seven-year-old daughter and the parents were lured to the barn where they were murdered one at a time. But I mean we're talking about the 1920s evidence collecting is not quite the same anymore. So really in this stage of the crime people don't know what happened. They believe that the perpetrator or perpetrators. They do not know how many people they use the pickaxe of belonging to the family.  Arm and killed the family with their own weapon. Basically, then the perpetrators moved into the house where they killed the maid in her bed with the same weapon and then presumably killed the two-year-old real sorry while he slept in his crib. So the family was lured to the barn the family was killed. The person went in the house got the maid and the remaining child. That's the basic premise. But even at this point people don't know.  So as you can imagine with the farm sort of out in the boonies, it took four days for people to discover that the family had actually died. They even had a machinist come out to the farm to work like to repair one of machines and he basically went worked and then left but he said he didn't he didn't even know. No, he said he didn't see any of the family and he heard nothing but sounds of the farm animals and the dog inside the bar.  So he's sort of waited around for a bit didn't see anybody thought. Well, I'm just going to do what I need to do left five hours later when he finished when he was in town. He talked about how it was super Erie and like the ghostly emptiness of the farm and how he didn't see anybody and basically that afternoon a party went back to the farm was like something's wrong. There's a lot of people at this farm and to not see anybody is not right. And so when they go back at this point four days later,  the bodies were found. It seems like it's so methodical because they would have had to know how many people were there to be able to like lure them out and like know what you're dealing because if you're it's not like you have this an automatic weapon where you're like you could you cannot to get to Graham about it. But like, you know, that's a lot of people try to contain. Yeah absolutely makes sense. And so it's almost even so Eerie. Oh, so they were worried about say they were all in the same place to threaten them into staying at the  Of those. Yeah word that makes sense to like lure them out. Look at like one after the other somehow or there I would have had to at least be like multiple people doing it. Yeah it I mean the crime itself is is super duper creepy and which is why I picked it. But also what's so frustrating is that the investigation was not really handled properly. Obviously, it's 1922. There's lots of things that they just didn't have or maybe hadn't even seen a crime like this before but basically  Basically, the crime was investigated by the Munich police and they originally were hampered by the number of people that interacted with the crime scene that bodies were moved that items removed even people cooked and ate in the Farms kitchen like while they were they're investigating. They're like, well, we're we're here who needs lunch kind of thing. Like they yeah the day after the discovery of the bodies the court physician performed the autopsies.  It was established that the madacorp like it's that basically an ice pick was most likely the murder weapon. The weapon itself was not at the scene. Then it goes on. I mean if some pretty Grim details, they're all pretty awful. I guess one of the things that makes this case a bit notorious. Oh is that the you can do it? I really do. All right. Here we go. Why do I always pick the most gruesome things to talk about? I'm so sorry, okay.  Okay, so the heads of the victims were removed and sent to Munich so they could be examined because the trauma all happen to the heads they thought well, why don't we just take all the heads and we'll go look at them in our lab. I'm not I am saying I know who's the head for evidence purposes and that's just Bonkers. Yeah all of them too. So they were kept in the Justice building and  We're later lost possibly destroyed in the Allied bombings of World War Two a couple days later after like all this happening. So we're just we're still in April the victims were buried in a cemetery. Obviously Sands heads. So imagine being like the UPS guy like who has to pick them up and take them and like you don't know or like, you know, yeah, I mean you go to the Post Office and that they asked you like what's inside is that yeah, it's me.  Like it's always just a book or always just a present for someone and you'll be like, oh this six human heads. Yeah, she's a success. And the first these has said they definitely had a bad review whoever like a prince put them someone's getting fired. I mean, uh, the police believe that the motive would be robbery but a large amount of money was actually found inside the house. So somebody did this for a very specific reason they realized that the  Trader or most likely perpetrators because obviously so many people died. I think it would be difficult if it was just one person, but they believe that the perpetrators stayed at the farm for several days after the killings because someone fed the cows had eaten an entire supply of bread from the kitchen took meat from the pantry. It's also possible. They were still there after the discovery of the bodies as neighbors reported smoke coming from the  the chimney after the fact did they not just check the house to be sure when they you know found the bodies. I mean, well, we'll get to that it's it gets creepier with no motive the police questioned more than a hundred suspects before closing the case in the 50s unsolved because it's such a notorious case and it's so gruesome and creepy there's still interest in it. But obviously at this point pretty much anybody associated with the Case is dead. There's no one left to talk.  So there there's a couple inconsistencies that mess up the investigation the original reporting belief that each family member went to the barn to the due to the restlessness sound of the animals. So it's almost like the animals were upset about something and then one by one they would go out to check on the animals, but then they found out that not even screams from the barn could be heard in the house. So why did for family members?  Boys go to the barn in the first place. They also the exact sequence of events. They couldn't be clarified without a doubt. They don't know really who died in what order or anything like that. There's only five pictures taken from the crime scene to with the bodies in the barn one of the maid in her bedroom. One of these small child's rekt crib and an outside view from the yard, no fingerprints were.  Secured the Assumption has always been that the killer was already on the premise and inside the roof before the ACT. Is it the roof? No, no. No because there were reports that they could hear footsteps and stuff. They believe that the Footsteps in the snow was them coming into the house and then the Footsteps in the Attic was them kind of moving around some of the evidence for this Theory includes that they were roof tiles that were shifted and there were like,  Hallowed bits out in hey, but then apparently and I don't know how substantiated is there might have been some activities by the father and daughter up in the roof that might be unrelated to the crime. So if that's the case, it makes sense why the father was like, oh nobody's up there because I move that stuff around or whatever on the night of the crime. So three days before the three or four days before the bodies were  Discovered this guy Michael actually passes the farm and he observed that the oven had been heated by somebody that person approached him with a lantern and kind of like freaked him out. So Michael like ran off basically. Nobody knows who that person was was it the killer was some was Michael like confused. We don't know but there's definitely a case that the person who did the crime or persons were already in the house and very likely they stayed in the house for a while afterwards, which is so  Fucking creepy. I just can't less than a year after the murders and the murder investigation. The farm was destroyed like completely demolished which actually revealed additional evidence including that ice pick that was hidden in the Attic since then the site has no structure other than a memorial Shrine. There's been no formal arrests or convictions or any sort of closure and that  That is the creepy and unsolved murder that I can't pronounce. I called terrifying than having someone in your Loft. Yeah, that's one of those light colors than waited and then killed you. Yeah, it's just like how they it was like they're obviously scoped it out. They had been there, you know ahead of time. It was all very planned and it didn't seem like did you say that they found money in the property?  Yeah, so originally they thought it was a robbery but then there was quite a lot of money that was not necessarily hidden that well in the farm like in the home and stuff so that like it's one thing is to kill somebody for money people do that all the time but to kill a whole family including a very small child and a maid like what what benefit do you have of that? Like why? Yeah creepy one more tip was that  Yeah, it's what I mean. It's like well unless I just wanted some food and drink and shelter. But I mean it seems extreme there was a couple suspects I won't go into them because as you can imagine there were tons. They were basically grasping at straws. One of them that I thought was kind of creepy was so there's the grown daughter who had the two children Victoria and her husband had reportedly been killed in the first world war. However his  She had never been recovered. So after the murders people get to speculate whether he actually did die or if he had sort of faked his death and then come back to the family because like I mentioned there was some talk that the Father Joseph and his daughter might have had the small child together the two-year-old boy. So the idea that this  actually dead husband came back and like to seek revenge and killed the family and whatever but there's like there's no evidence and it's basically that I'm just like pulling at straws. That's wild. That's a good that is very creepy story. I want to say it's called the hinter caffeic murder, but we'll post details and stuff like on the blog and whatever and you guys can check it out, but I generally thought normally I don't like unsolved crimes because it drives me nuts, but there's something  Out something about this one the fact that they were in the house like just spooky spooky creepy time.  The one I picked for today is actually also technically unsolved. However, it's pretty likely they know the suspect actually has pretty spot on it and it was that suspect who did it, but it's kind of along the same lines of like the and I'm the same I hate and solve crimes because like I don't like to like Listen to Bottom because then I'm like, oh great. Well, I've just listen to this seven part podcast and we have no conclusion. All right, so I'm not going to tell you guys what the my murders are called. Well what?  There because you've probably heard of it. I don't know if you know anything about them or I have listened anything on them, but it is it's pretty well known, but I'm going to tell you the story and then I'll tell you what it sort of is what it's called. So there's many reasons this frightens me and I will explain those sort of after or you'll get the hint of it. Anyway on the 23rd of June 1965 Houston Police attended a house to do a welfare. Check Marvin Martin had earlier placed a call to police to  Check up on his aunt and uncle Fred and Edwina Rogers as he had not been able to reach them for several days two police officers knocked on the door and eventually kicked it in as they could not gain a response a walkthrough of the house eventually LED them to the kitchen. Well, one of the patrolmen was compelled to open the refrigerator after noticing food out on the counter inside. He saw what he believed were stacks of hogs meet until they opened the crispr only to find the heads of the two homes residents Fred and Edwina.  It was of course. Sorry it was of course not Hogs mate and instead the limbs and torso of the residents in their own fridge and their own fridge. Yes. So obviously that is incredibly horrifying and it gets worse. I feel quite safe knowing that I've got quite a small fridge. Yeah saying, but I think if someone came in and killed me and James they would face in the fridge now no and I don't scrimp. But yeah, I know I mean, you know silver.  Earning and all that a subsequent autopsy and investigation LED them to believe the following occurred and I've actually tried to like take this down three days prior to the discovery of the bodies Fred Rogers was attacked and killed by blows to the head with a claw hammer. His eyes have been gouged out. You said you were turning it down that is toned down. Oh my God, Edwina Rogers had been beaten and shot execution-style in the head. The bodies were then dismembered in the upstairs bathroom by someone with at least some knowledge.  Of anatomy, there are organs had been found in nearby sewer as I'd been flushed down the toilet again. This is tone down the house have been thoroughly cleaned and the only blood led to a bedroom where they discovered a bloody Keyhole saw the bedroom belong to their son Charles Rogers and he was nowhere to be found. So Rogers was described as a reclusive and reportedly and reportedly communicated with his parents by way of notes that he slipped under the door.  Our neighbors were even unaware that Rogers lived with his parents as he generally less a home Before Dawn and did not return until after dark. So at that point, I mean, he just disappeared like he was nowhere to be found in the house and actually to this day he was never found he declared he was declared dead in 1975 or dad and absentee. A' I don't even it's like I guess he'd been gone for long enough that it's that when you your pronounced it in absence of a good day. Yeah, I think yeah.  Lord leaking. Yeah, yes, exactly. But that was they did that because they wanted to they needed to settle his estate. So so he remained the only suspect in the murders, but they're actually still considered unsolved. So let's talk about Charles Charles Frederick Rogers was born in 1921 to Fred Medina Roger attend Rogers attented a tentative can't speak attended the University of Houston where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in nuclear.  Physics during World War II he was a pilot in the United States Navy and also served in the Office of Naval intelligence after the war. He worked as a seismologist seismologist seismologist. Yes, but squeaks. Yes. Yes. I had to look it up because I couldn't you are correct. Couldn't remember what that was for Shale oil for nine years. He abruptly quit his job and 1957 without giving any explanation and that sort of went he went and I started staying with us.  Aaron's but he actually he was actually he's really smart. He's a very smart intelligent guy. He actually was really successful in her career his career and then obviously he just quit and then was living with his parents the police never really got anywhere with the investigation but reefs in recent years to forensics epa's from Houston started to investigate the case because obviously it was officially never saw of mainly they're pretty sure it was him that did it but he had obviously just  He's fled and they could never find him. So they really wanted to get to the bottom of what actually happened to where if they could track where Rogers went. So they begin tracing the money and trying to piece together what happened? So they did after some investigation. They realized that Charles childhood was really Grim with fried and Weena, they're full of alcohol emotional physical abuse from his parents, which subsequently Charles was a loner but he was like I said before extremely intelligent they found out that Charles actually owned his parents.  And then his parents had been ripping him off by taking out loans against the house and then keeping the money for himself themselves. So what the to CPAs did were they followed the money they were able to place with start to track forensically track the money like where he was able like where he went and during their investigation. They realize that Charles had escaped to Mexico and then to South America with the help of several friends and they think that he had friends that helped them because people made a lot of money for him because what he did is he  ERM he knew where all the oil was and he could had a lot of business connections and then they believed that his friend did actually help them and then obviously never said anything. They also believe Rogers was eventually killed though later on in Honduras over a coal-mining dispute. If he was alive today, he would be nearly a hundred. So of course, he wouldn't be alive anyway like at the state and so that is basically what we'll call the icebox murders. Oh see I've heard of that name, but I  I did not know any of that story. Yeah, I've heard the name to and I didn't really and I think the reason it really freaks me out is because imagine this like because I think when you start to read it or start to read about it, you just think this weirdo loner man living in his parents house and then he one day just like snaps and then kills his parents, but that is so and of course I left some of the details about what actually he did to the bodies, but that is like he didn't just kill them. He like mutilated their bodies he cut them up for sure.  Organs down the toilet chopped them up put them in the freezer because that is hatred, you know full-on planned out. Yeah, that would mean that there will some kind of motive. Yeah exactly. Like he obviously wasn't just human he snapped it was like something. Yeah. He didn't just say he's probably in their planning it and especially if it sounds like the parents were pretty toxic anyway, and maybe he just had enough I've had enough now, I'm going to get out of here and I think that's why it freaks me out that there's somebody that you could imagine somebody live with doing that and then think I'm  Part of it is so he was never found. So he managed to just escape and it's like something out of a movie where because they he just escaped to South America and then was like never seen again. That's crazy. Especially the fact that he was really successful. It wasn't that he lived at home and and never talk to anybody or never worked a day in his life or anything like very successful very intelligent and obviously very intelligent.  If he was able to escape and to not be found because I can't imagine how difficult that would be. Although I guess I mean in the in the 60s and 70s, it's a bit different but even still yeah exactly. I mean, I think it's probably easier to disappear back then obviously now, it's really probably a lot harder but it's still it's just I just found it really creepy just the idea of just the idea of him just being in that room and like slipping notes under the door didn't want to have anything to do with parents anyway, and the fact that the neighbors didn't even know that he was living there.  It was on. Can you imagine being those investigators though? Like that would traumatize you for the rest of your life? Yeah, you just open it open the door to the fridge and you see the heads in the crisper. Oh my God. No, but at least a year neither had 12. I'm like a long story. I know these feathers so they're sitting in a warehouse somewhere in Germany FedEx. Sorry, it's not funny. It's not funny.  Or I did a story and then I changed it because it wasn't right. So have you heard of the smiley face murders I've heard of oh, yes, but not not in depth. Yeah. Okay. So I'm gonna start off with a humble brag. So as you both know, I recently graduated with a criminology degree and for a social science degree. There was like a huge amount of Statistics with inner and something that a couple of people in my module groups really struggled with the understanding that just  Is two things are happening at the same time doesn't necessarily mean that they're connected or that they correlate in any way. So for example whilst like rainfall and wind shield wiper use would correlate finding a dead body in a river and there being a smiley face graffiti on the wall might not necessarily be connected, but for Kevin Gannon and Antony do art. I'm sorry, if I thought that who are retired and former NYPD detectives and legal.  Robertson who is a criminal justice Professor. There is a correlation between finding missing young white college-educated men in rivers and finding graffiti at the crime scene. Wow, when I like classic calling card. Yes. So when I first heard the story I was like bullshit but one of my late night deep dives into the internet Ganondorf and Gilbertson could have looked like quite compelling Theory and it verges on being a conspiracy theory which as you know, I enjoy  So they believe since 2008 some 40 cases have been mislabeled as accidental or undetermined drownings, but they're actually murders. Jeez. So since then their database of potential victims victims and suspicious drownings has risen to 355. They've added in additional physical evidence. And the first thing they say is D competently decomposition of these these bodies so they believe that some victims were missing for like a really long period of time  And some of them up to 40 days a year when their bodies are found the decomposition of them has only been like a few days like three days or two and a half days Gannon who I can't say the name Gannon without thinking of a video game Boss in Legend of Zelda life. So he's not Gannon or Gammon like the diamond Gannon. Okay. Yeah. So Gannon highlights lividity patterns, which is like how blood settles in a dead body lack of  Ting and the presence of insects which normally found on land which will indicate that these victims actually died on land or in the water the detectives the other two detectives do I think Gannon they highlight that there's often presence of GHB drug like the date rape drug in their systems in 99.9% of the victims. Yeah, interestingly. GHB is not often included in post-mortem toxicology tests really know so it's often.  Family of the victims for them to request that this test be undertaken or by the coroner or samples have been requested to be sent to this Trio for them to test for their research. So the outcome of this is basically they believe that these men are abducted murdered and then placed in the water. They want these deaths to be reclassified as homicides. And then their second priority is that they want to show that there is a link between them. So between all these murders for them and that link is  Is that there is often one of 13 symbols including a smiley face graffiti near the crime scene. So there's actually other symbols as well. Yeah, there's obviously been a huge rebuttals to this the FBI know they had quote not developed any evidence to support links between these tragic deaths or any evidence substantiating the theory that these deaths are the work of a serial killers and the vast majority of these instances appeared to be alcohol-related drowning and we live in like Southeast England in Kent and suddenly we see every now and then especially in the  Like young intoxicating than falling in a cold River and passing away the World Health Organization State their men are statistically more likely to die or be hospitalized from drowning and further that men are more likely to engage in Risky behaviors where the consuming alcohol or not. So like being like a dare of jumping in a river or, you know, having a little regard for their safety well on a lighter note, I mean just  Go on YouTube and you can see all the stupid videos of like men like yeah doing crazy stunts like jumping off a house into it. Whatever and you're right. Yeah, so there's actually been little physical evidence on the body is that the cases are anything but accidental drownings, so there's no blunt force trauma. There's no strangulation and there's no signs of torture and further that is called homicidal drowning. So when you physically drowns on one bike you want to kill them. It's very very rare. So dumping a body in  Doesn't wash away evidence. This is commonly believed dumping a body in cold water can actually preserve evidence such as wound patterns and it's pretty easy now to lift latent fingerprints from victim skins. So I know we talked about it in mind Hunter when we did our mind Hunter of you there. We talked about Wayne Williams who was convicted of the always believed to be responsible for the Atlanta child murders. So he's conviction was ultimately secured by Blood and fiber evidence.  Once obtained from bodies he jumped he dumped in a river. So that shows you like this cause you're dumping a body in River doesn't mean that all the evidence can be washed away and you know, you won't get caught and it just is not true. It doesn't happen. This smiley face graffiti being present is also being questioned. There's numerous photos of the faces spray-painted there are available and they're all different in style and start like size and the time frames different as well. Someone painted like a really long time ago. So I painted after the murders.  You think about it like graffiti spree like omnipresent everywhere? Yeah, and what's a common thing that you would graffiti on a wall like this something easy or a dick? Yeah. So that's a penis. We are just like giant pain. So the sensor for homicide research know in their 2010 research paper that this cheery graffiti is a cynical slap at the police by the vandals. So it's like quite a common a common thing for me. Yeah, so  So what do you think are these young white college-educated men falling and drowning rivers or is there something more Sinister? That's really tough? Because it does have the G8 all of them a lot of them having the GHB in their system. That's like a yeah. I mean I know that it can is also used as a recreational drug as well. Yeah, people take it. Yeah people just take yeah and also say if you re looking like little something and you're like gonna take a pill of someone you don't know what's in it. Yeah. Did you let him is in liquid form as  It so they'll build it and it's easy for somebody to put in a drink. I mean, I know that like near where we live like you mentioned you'll get especially around Christmas time. I think because people are out drinking in the waters really cold and we've had some of the drownings and fortunately in similar circumstance, but I do think it's just it's really okay. Maybe the smiley faces are stretched far too far, like maybe that's not you know, like you said two things can be happening, but they're not necessarily related but  But it does sound it just seems like a really high number of a very similar deaths unless that is just a truly common thing is it I don't yeah, I mean a lot of their figures come from the US and I'm saying the u.s. Is massive. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of people. Oh, yeah, what kind of like confuses me is that if there is no physical trauma to the body, so they're not if you say you had all these bodies washing up that look like they had been strangled. Okay, definitely something's going on there.  The fact that the body has like has nothing nothing except drowning like that seems hard to getting some of them do have some of them did have like injury to them. But I'm sure that could be believed to be that you know, so they hit their head and then stumbled into the river or you know, it's not yes, I think so. I personally believe it's a bit of a conspiracy theory. I think it sounds like a good you know, one of those good serial killer  the movies. Yeah, you kind of like I think it's really human to make sense of like a tragedy by believing that there is a conspiracy theory. Yeah. Thank you live with like if you live with uncertainty and like doubts pretty hard to like process. It's always easier to hold on to something else. Like it being a bigger. I think in grief that may be that there's a bigger picture or there's a bigger, you know that it's not the person the victims fault, you know, by being careless or it's just not a horrible thing that happened.  Is much easier I think to find blame and something else because there's a criminologist Scott Bond and he kind of notes that we seek to control what we fear and by believing in a conspiracy theory, it's kind of like protects you from the world around you it reduces everything to like us versus done and it lets you like pointer finger. It lets you blame someone you blame something and that's how people do a tragedy so I found that reading  Arresting hope you did too. I got my precious head. Yeah, there's a really good article on Rolling Stone were a lot more information came from about this and they actually Lincoln quite a lot of the like research papers that have been done by like the center for homicide research, which I read on it. So it's a really really good article and put links on the website. That's all I need I think as well if something starts to grow in terms of like a myth or a story or it gets publicity.  Are you hearing about like there's these smiley faces? Like I'm sure there's going to be people that will go out there and do them as like a copycat. They're not killing anybody or anything, but they're putting up these creepy smiley faces to be part of that sort of yeah story. Yeah. I definitely think you'll find that or it could just be as simple as what you said before. It's just something that when you know, when you're like doodling on like a little sheet of paper like you're on the phone you're like waiting on hold and something whatever.  Ever it's just a common thing you we travel even you know what? I mean? I don't know. It's just kind of one of those things like so who it could just be just trying too hard to connect these dots that aren't really you know there.  Alright guys, I guess that is kind of wraps it up for us.

Go check it out download the free anchor app or go to Anchored off dot f m-- to get started. Okay, let's get back to the show.  Today's words are fatuous, silly and pointless apocryphal.  Of doubtful authenticity, although widely circulated as being true usually in regards to a story or statement a credit e having an acrid smell accurate is having an irritant Lee Strong and unpleasant taste or smell angry bitter.  Trench in see in size of - keenness and forcefulness of thought or expression or intellect euphony the quality of being pleasing to the ear, especially through a harmonious combination of words.  Trump trump Trump trump no matter what you think of him. You got to admit. He's very entertaining especially when it comes to his tweets.  A lot of his tweets are completely fascists. Remember the the whole kafei tweet where he tweeted a word that said Kofi. I like 2:00 in the morning unbelievable. Basically all of his tweets are trenchant. He's very bold once everyone to listen every once in a while though. He'll have a rather euphonious comment. I assume those pleasing tweets are in by his professional speech writers right now is impeachment trial is  Underway, some say is conversation with Ukrainian president clearly frames it but others say it that is apocryphal. We'll just have to see what happens.  That's all for GRE vocab. We wish you guys the best of luck if you're taking the test this week.  Also, if you wouldn't mind leaving us a review the be much appreciated. Thanks so much. See you next time.\n"
