              " \"Hi everyone, and welcome to murder friends the podcast were three friends from three different countries talk about murder. My name is Alana and I'm Canadian. Hi, I'm Anna and I'm American. My name is Hannah and I'm British. So sit back and relax you're among friends. And let's talk murder. Now. Today's episode is really special because it is the conclusion of spooky month. Which in my opinion is probably the best month. You're right. I love Halloween is the best time of year. For the whole month, really? Yes spooky season. It's pretty great. I mean in general you could start wearing sweaters boots, you know, go completely black and goth and coffee. Yeah spice lattes if that's your sort of basic thing, you know, which is because it is and if you're a more murdery, no than its quad gourd season. Yeah, exactly. The only thing that I've noticed so I've been living in England for just a couple of years. And England doesn't do Halloween like North America does which is kind of a bummer, but I guess I just sort of get used to it. Where is like in Canada? It feels like everything is draped in fake cobwebs from like October 5th and on like the stores go all out all the houses go all out costumes go all out. We're here in England. Not that so much of a popular thing. Now, it's I noticed that too because I'm America as well. It's insane. Like people go nuts for Halloween. It's a big thing. I mean nobody costume people decorate their whole house. I mean some go even more nuts than Christmas with the whole house decorating. I mean, it's a massive massive thing and every house participates like here you might get obviously I have a little one so I have been trick-or-treating here with her and you might get like two houses on the street. It's just it's pretty pathetic but  But it's only because you guys don't do it. Yeah, I was never really like a thing when I was a kid. I mean it really bad Halloween, but we never went trick-or-treating we didn't do like costumes that much there were like the occasional Halloween party. But like that was a yeah, but I think that's mainly because we don't a bigger event in the UK is probably Guy Fawkes Night. Yeah, and it's so full of November. Yes, I bonfire night which is I think more of our like traditionally  British thing today. Yes, you do firework doesn't everything you don't think we set things on fire. So we do that more in Fourth of July. Yeah. I just remember like growing up in Canada Halloween you get your costume ready? Like two months in advance. So shout out to know you're like you're literally talking about it. Aren't you like for with your friends? Oh, yeah who can come up with the best costume? Yes, and then you all go to Value Village. Shout out to Value Village anybody who lived loves Value Village they are  Like a charity shop, but they go full out on Halloween because everybody goes there to buy their costume. So like you by bits and pieces and whatever so you go to Value Village. I remember one year. I must have been I want to say like nine and I was a mad scientist for Halloween true story. I'll have to dig up a picture and my mom was so good at costumes. We got this white lab coat and then ping pong balls. We like glued all over and Drew like little eyeballs on them.  And then I got like a one of the you know, like the dollar store has like a packet of plastic bugs so glued plastic bags all over I had a giant like plastic rat that we like so to my shoulder and then my mom in her absolute Grace and wisdom because it is a Halloween in Canada and it's fucking cold. She built this hat. Basically that was pink sort of like Shivani material that she  She sewed and wrapped up and put it onto a hat. So it looked like an exposed. Brain. Oh my God. Yeah, I'm not kidding and buy things like oh, so it's like a it looks really fucking cool. You're a mad scientist with an exposed brain and be your warm as hell because it's an actual hat and it's Halloween in Canada. So it might be snowing. I just like that is Halloween next to buying and a Ouija board from Zellers and then like doing the basement and like getting everybody.  Is that to me is like the perfect Halloween?  That's so funny that you mentioned about because you do have to factor in that you have to be warm because it's cold. So where I grew up in the DC area and it was cold. So you have to fact that you have your costume, but you have to work in how to get a jacket or like yeah thermals underneath it. So yeah take that into account. A lot of times you'd like by if you were buying costume at least you have to buy like a size too big so you can get your coat on underneath but then complain because it's like well, I want to be like a sexy  Cheerleader but I Gotta Wear My snowsuit on underneath this costume exactly exactly, but it was always I think more now they may call you get like the cheap Chinese with not Chinese, but I guess they made in China. They're made somewhere in a factory where they Mass produce like, you know, just the cheap costumes that you can buy where I love the the generic names on those. Oh, yeah, you're it's like wizard boy and this one. Yeah, exactly clearly a Harry Potter costume or something and do not stand close to an open flame because that now  they're definitely not claiming tried. I think they had to like legally start making them like whether like, you know, you're not just gonna immediately burst into flames like a child like you go near a feat only composed. Yeah, baby. I know back when I was younger to we made a lot of costumes that's like a big deal was to make them more so and that brings me to one of the things one of my costumes and I was desperately trying to find a picture right before we started and I'm gonna find it post it on the socials but one year.  Cited and this is the most non-scary geekiest thing ever, but I don't know why I've insisted I wanted to go as an artist. So I just wore this outfit where I made myself one of those  What are they called? Like I had a beret I have like this whole outfit with oh, do you have got a little bored? I'm bored. What are those things the palette palette and a paintbrush a carrier out and that and I just walk because I was like, I don't know but it was just and in that picture I have on white sweatpants and sweat shirt underneath the stuff because you know how you're trying again. You're trying to make yourself as warm as possible. So you have to like layer up. What kind of age are we talking here? Oh, I was like ten I mean and then nobody knew what I was.  Okay, let me know. What kid goes as an artist for Halloween. Like what a loser. I think between that and wanting to be an M&M one year, but that was like yeah, do you mean the kind of Eminem? I was a green one to be exact. Okay, but it was like I think you can probably buy the generic costumes now, but like what we live full on made it with like felt felt was your best friend Allie?  Queen oh, yeah, I remember one year. I it was a Value Village costume. We when I was a cheerleader like the most unsexy looking cheerleader, but I wanted to be a dead cheerleader because I thought I would be okay cool. So I bought a bunch of fake blood and you can get those it's almost I don't know what the material is but you put it on your face and spread it out and it looks like skin. It's disgusting and I need to cover my face in. Yeah, just not nice.  That was like a homemade Value Village. Let's not do a cheerleader. Let's do a dead cheerleader and it was disgusting like 13, right? That's cool. Yeah, but I just knowing you you're so not a chick like you're just like the opposite of like cheerleader, but then you say dead cheerleader and okay, that's definitely more you but then I think obviously Hannah you didn't do the trick or treating stuff. But I feel like you make it up. You've been making it up and your later adult life, but just by being a golf. Yeah exactly.  Really? You're like Halloween every day. You're not wrong. So, thanks.  So for this episode we were talking about what we wanted to do for spooky month and I think it was like this time last year maybe when we went camping maybe like late September. So the three of us went camping in Rye here in England and it was I don't know it was dark out. We all set out by our little homemade fire and we told murder mystery stories. So each of us told the story. It was super creepy. I'm sure everybody who was  Also camping was equally terrified because I'm pretty sure like our voices carry through that whole Campground, but I kind of wanted to do something similar where we gather around our virtual fire outside its spooky month and we're each going to tell a spooky murder mystery.  Normally here at murder friends. We tend to have fairly light episodes. Nothing to To Grim. I'd like to think a little bit a little bit lighter, but this is a different episode. So if you're not interested in really creepy fairly gruesome crimes, please go ahead and listen to one of our other episodes. This is just a special one-time thing. All of our episodes will not be this Grim. I promise.  I did some research on creepy stories. There's a couple that come to mind but none of them were really fitting and I found this one that I sort of did a little bit of a deep dive on and I yeah, you'll see why I chose it. So to set the scene imagine you're living at your family farm. It's beautiful Farm out in the in the woods your beloved maid quits because she keeps  Hearing strange noises in the house. That sucks not the end of the world but a bit creepy then you start finding newspapers in the house that no one in the family bought their actually from a city that's quite far away which nobody's travel to the house keys. Keep going missing. You see fresh footprints in the snow coming from the Dark Forest towards your farm leading to a broken door in the Farms machine room, but there are no tracks away from the  House, so the house on fire pretty much this guy. So this is the beginning of the infamous and I'm so sorry to all to German listeners hit hit enter. Now, I'm going to post it. I can't say I'm so sorry, but it is the story of the murders that happen at this Farmstead in 1922. So we got we're going back in time to a spooky.  Mystery out in Germany. So this is just a tiny small farm set about 70 kilometres north of Munich. It's one of the most gruesome and puzzling unsolved crimes in German history and it gave me nightmares. So on the evening of March thirty first nineteen twenty to six inhabitants of the farm were killed with a mattock which is like a pickaxe basically so the six victims  were the parents and dries and Seville again, so sorry for the names their Widow Widow daughter Victoria who was in her 30s and then Victoria's children who were seven and two and their new maid Maria. So like I mentioned some weird stuff started to happen before the attack so finding newspapers finding tracks to the house, but not out of the house the original  You'd quit. They was creepy noises in the night the family heard Footsteps in the Attic, but the father found nobody when he was searching the building. So overall 100% nightmare fuel creepy time. You do wonder which I'm sure I'll get to how do you kill six different people there? It's noisy or they going to be somebody's gonna wake up and then rot. I mean, it's just it seems insane. It's so it's so creepy. Anyway, okay, so  the father actually told several people about these observations, but he basically refused to accept help the details went unreported to the police. He was basically like I'm going to deal with it. It's not a big deal. No worries the family also reported seeing a man with a mustache. That's the only description we have a man with a mustache standing at the forage forests Edge and just staring at the house basically like watching them. Oh fuck creepy.  Also, I mean, it's a free country. I guess you can look wherever you want to look. So on the afternoon of the 31st the new maid Maria arrived. So Maria's sister a squirter her there and then left the farm shortly afterwards the sisters likely the last person to see everyone alive. So she literally drops off her sister at her new job. And then that's it. Basically the police believe that in the evening the sort of eldest daughter.  Victoria her seven-year-old daughter and the parents were lured to the barn where they were murdered one at a time. But I mean we're talking about the 1920s evidence collecting is not quite the same anymore. So really in this stage of the crime people don't know what happened. They believe that the perpetrator or perpetrators. They do not know how many people they use the pickaxe of belonging to the family.  Arm and killed the family with their own weapon. Basically, then the perpetrators moved into the house where they killed the maid in her bed with the same weapon and then presumably killed the two-year-old real sorry while he slept in his crib. So the family was lured to the barn the family was killed. The person went in the house got the maid and the remaining child. That's the basic premise. But even at this point people don't know.  So as you can imagine with the farm sort of out in the boonies, it took four days for people to discover that the family had actually died. They even had a machinist come out to the farm to work like to repair one of machines and he basically went worked and then left but he said he didn't he didn't even know. No, he said he didn't see any of the family and he heard nothing but sounds of the farm animals and the dog inside the bar.  So he's sort of waited around for a bit didn't see anybody thought. Well, I'm just going to do what I need to do left five hours later when he finished when he was in town. He talked about how it was super Erie and like the ghostly emptiness of the farm and how he didn't see anybody and basically that afternoon a party went back to the farm was like something's wrong. There's a lot of people at this farm and to not see anybody is not right. And so when they go back at this point four days later,  the bodies were found. It seems like it's so methodical because they would have had to know how many people were there to be able to like lure them out and like know what you're dealing because if you're it's not like you have this an automatic weapon where you're like you could you cannot to get to Graham about it. But like, you know, that's a lot of people try to contain. Yeah absolutely makes sense. And so it's almost even so Eerie. Oh, so they were worried about say they were all in the same place to threaten them into staying at the  Of those. Yeah word that makes sense to like lure them out. Look at like one after the other somehow or there I would have had to at least be like multiple people doing it. Yeah it I mean the crime itself is is super duper creepy and which is why I picked it. But also what's so frustrating is that the investigation was not really handled properly. Obviously, it's 1922. There's lots of things that they just didn't have or maybe hadn't even seen a crime like this before but basically  Basically, the crime was investigated by the Munich police and they originally were hampered by the number of people that interacted with the crime scene that bodies were moved that items removed even people cooked and ate in the Farms kitchen like while they were they're investigating. They're like, well, we're we're here who needs lunch kind of thing. Like they yeah the day after the discovery of the bodies the court physician performed the autopsies.  It was established that the madacorp like it's that basically an ice pick was most likely the murder weapon. The weapon itself was not at the scene. Then it goes on. I mean if some pretty Grim details, they're all pretty awful. I guess one of the things that makes this case a bit notorious. Oh is that the you can do it? I really do. All right. Here we go. Why do I always pick the most gruesome things to talk about? I'm so sorry, okay.  Okay, so the heads of the victims were removed and sent to Munich so they could be examined because the trauma all happen to the heads they thought well, why don't we just take all the heads and we'll go look at them in our lab. I'm not I am saying I know who's the head for evidence purposes and that's just Bonkers. Yeah all of them too. So they were kept in the Justice building and  We're later lost possibly destroyed in the Allied bombings of World War Two a couple days later after like all this happening. So we're just we're still in April the victims were buried in a cemetery. Obviously Sands heads. So imagine being like the UPS guy like who has to pick them up and take them and like you don't know or like, you know, yeah, I mean you go to the Post Office and that they asked you like what's inside is that yeah, it's me.  Like it's always just a book or always just a present for someone and you'll be like, oh this six human heads. Yeah, she's a success. And the first these has said they definitely had a bad review whoever like a prince put them someone's getting fired. I mean, uh, the police believe that the motive would be robbery but a large amount of money was actually found inside the house. So somebody did this for a very specific reason they realized that the  Trader or most likely perpetrators because obviously so many people died. I think it would be difficult if it was just one person, but they believe that the perpetrators stayed at the farm for several days after the killings because someone fed the cows had eaten an entire supply of bread from the kitchen took meat from the pantry. It's also possible. They were still there after the discovery of the bodies as neighbors reported smoke coming from the  the chimney after the fact did they not just check the house to be sure when they you know found the bodies. I mean, well, we'll get to that it's it gets creepier with no motive the police questioned more than a hundred suspects before closing the case in the 50s unsolved because it's such a notorious case and it's so gruesome and creepy there's still interest in it. But obviously at this point pretty much anybody associated with the Case is dead. There's no one left to talk.  So there there's a couple inconsistencies that mess up the investigation the original reporting belief that each family member went to the barn to the due to the restlessness sound of the animals. So it's almost like the animals were upset about something and then one by one they would go out to check on the animals, but then they found out that not even screams from the barn could be heard in the house. So why did for family members?  Boys go to the barn in the first place. They also the exact sequence of events. They couldn't be clarified without a doubt. They don't know really who died in what order or anything like that. There's only five pictures taken from the crime scene to with the bodies in the barn one of the maid in her bedroom. One of these small child's rekt crib and an outside view from the yard, no fingerprints were.  Secured the Assumption has always been that the killer was already on the premise and inside the roof before the ACT. Is it the roof? No, no. No because there were reports that they could hear footsteps and stuff. They believe that the Footsteps in the snow was them coming into the house and then the Footsteps in the Attic was them kind of moving around some of the evidence for this Theory includes that they were roof tiles that were shifted and there were like,  Hallowed bits out in hey, but then apparently and I don't know how substantiated is there might have been some activities by the father and daughter up in the roof that might be unrelated to the crime. So if that's the case, it makes sense why the father was like, oh nobody's up there because I move that stuff around or whatever on the night of the crime. So three days before the three or four days before the bodies were  Discovered this guy Michael actually passes the farm and he observed that the oven had been heated by somebody that person approached him with a lantern and kind of like freaked him out. So Michael like ran off basically. Nobody knows who that person was was it the killer was some was Michael like confused. We don't know but there's definitely a case that the person who did the crime or persons were already in the house and very likely they stayed in the house for a while afterwards, which is so  Fucking creepy. I just can't less than a year after the murders and the murder investigation. The farm was destroyed like completely demolished which actually revealed additional evidence including that ice pick that was hidden in the Attic since then the site has no structure other than a memorial Shrine. There's been no formal arrests or convictions or any sort of closure and that  That is the creepy and unsolved murder that I can't pronounce. I called terrifying than having someone in your Loft. Yeah, that's one of those light colors than waited and then killed you. Yeah, it's just like how they it was like they're obviously scoped it out. They had been there, you know ahead of time. It was all very planned and it didn't seem like did you say that they found money in the property?  Yeah, so originally they thought it was a robbery but then there was quite a lot of money that was not necessarily hidden that well in the farm like in the home and stuff so that like it's one thing is to kill somebody for money people do that all the time but to kill a whole family including a very small child and a maid like what what benefit do you have of that? Like why? Yeah creepy one more tip was that  Yeah, it's what I mean. It's like well unless I just wanted some food and drink and shelter. But I mean it seems extreme there was a couple suspects I won't go into them because as you can imagine there were tons. They were basically grasping at straws. One of them that I thought was kind of creepy was so there's the grown daughter who had the two children Victoria and her husband had reportedly been killed in the first world war. However his  She had never been recovered. So after the murders people get to speculate whether he actually did die or if he had sort of faked his death and then come back to the family because like I mentioned there was some talk that the Father Joseph and his daughter might have had the small child together the two-year-old boy. So the idea that this  actually dead husband came back and like to seek revenge and killed the family and whatever but there's like there's no evidence and it's basically that I'm just like pulling at straws. That's wild. That's a good that is very creepy story. I want to say it's called the hinter caffeic murder, but we'll post details and stuff like on the blog and whatever and you guys can check it out, but I generally thought normally I don't like unsolved crimes because it drives me nuts, but there's something  Out something about this one the fact that they were in the house like just spooky spooky creepy time.  The one I picked for today is actually also technically unsolved. However, it's pretty likely they know the suspect actually has pretty spot on it and it was that suspect who did it, but it's kind of along the same lines of like the and I'm the same I hate and solve crimes because like I don't like to like Listen to Bottom because then I'm like, oh great. Well, I've just listen to this seven part podcast and we have no conclusion. All right, so I'm not going to tell you guys what the my murders are called. Well what?  There because you've probably heard of it. I don't know if you know anything about them or I have listened anything on them, but it is it's pretty well known, but I'm going to tell you the story and then I'll tell you what it sort of is what it's called. So there's many reasons this frightens me and I will explain those sort of after or you'll get the hint of it. Anyway on the 23rd of June 1965 Houston Police attended a house to do a welfare. Check Marvin Martin had earlier placed a call to police to  Check up on his aunt and uncle Fred and Edwina Rogers as he had not been able to reach them for several days two police officers knocked on the door and eventually kicked it in as they could not gain a response a walkthrough of the house eventually LED them to the kitchen. Well, one of the patrolmen was compelled to open the refrigerator after noticing food out on the counter inside. He saw what he believed were stacks of hogs meet until they opened the crispr only to find the heads of the two homes residents Fred and Edwina.  It was of course. Sorry it was of course not Hogs mate and instead the limbs and torso of the residents in their own fridge and their own fridge. Yes. So obviously that is incredibly horrifying and it gets worse. I feel quite safe knowing that I've got quite a small fridge. Yeah saying, but I think if someone came in and killed me and James they would face in the fridge now no and I don't scrimp. But yeah, I know I mean, you know silver.  Earning and all that a subsequent autopsy and investigation LED them to believe the following occurred and I've actually tried to like take this down three days prior to the discovery of the bodies Fred Rogers was attacked and killed by blows to the head with a claw hammer. His eyes have been gouged out. You said you were turning it down that is toned down. Oh my God, Edwina Rogers had been beaten and shot execution-style in the head. The bodies were then dismembered in the upstairs bathroom by someone with at least some knowledge.  Of anatomy, there are organs had been found in nearby sewer as I'd been flushed down the toilet again. This is tone down the house have been thoroughly cleaned and the only blood led to a bedroom where they discovered a bloody Keyhole saw the bedroom belong to their son Charles Rogers and he was nowhere to be found. So Rogers was described as a reclusive and reportedly and reportedly communicated with his parents by way of notes that he slipped under the door.  Our neighbors were even unaware that Rogers lived with his parents as he generally less a home Before Dawn and did not return until after dark. So at that point, I mean, he just disappeared like he was nowhere to be found in the house and actually to this day he was never found he declared he was declared dead in 1975 or dad and absentee. A' I don't even it's like I guess he'd been gone for long enough that it's that when you your pronounced it in absence of a good day. Yeah, I think yeah.  Lord leaking. Yeah, yes, exactly. But that was they did that because they wanted to they needed to settle his estate. So so he remained the only suspect in the murders, but they're actually still considered unsolved. So let's talk about Charles Charles Frederick Rogers was born in 1921 to Fred Medina Roger attend Rogers attented a tentative can't speak attended the University of Houston where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in nuclear.  Physics during World War II he was a pilot in the United States Navy and also served in the Office of Naval intelligence after the war. He worked as a seismologist seismologist seismologist. Yes, but squeaks. Yes. Yes. I had to look it up because I couldn't you are correct. Couldn't remember what that was for Shale oil for nine years. He abruptly quit his job and 1957 without giving any explanation and that sort of went he went and I started staying with us.  Aaron's but he actually he was actually he's really smart. He's a very smart intelligent guy. He actually was really successful in her career his career and then obviously he just quit and then was living with his parents the police never really got anywhere with the investigation but reefs in recent years to forensics epa's from Houston started to investigate the case because obviously it was officially never saw of mainly they're pretty sure it was him that did it but he had obviously just  He's fled and they could never find him. So they really wanted to get to the bottom of what actually happened to where if they could track where Rogers went. So they begin tracing the money and trying to piece together what happened? So they did after some investigation. They realized that Charles childhood was really Grim with fried and Weena, they're full of alcohol emotional physical abuse from his parents, which subsequently Charles was a loner but he was like I said before extremely intelligent they found out that Charles actually owned his parents.  And then his parents had been ripping him off by taking out loans against the house and then keeping the money for himself themselves. So what the to CPAs did were they followed the money they were able to place with start to track forensically track the money like where he was able like where he went and during their investigation. They realize that Charles had escaped to Mexico and then to South America with the help of several friends and they think that he had friends that helped them because people made a lot of money for him because what he did is he  ERM he knew where all the oil was and he could had a lot of business connections and then they believed that his friend did actually help them and then obviously never said anything. They also believe Rogers was eventually killed though later on in Honduras over a coal-mining dispute. If he was alive today, he would be nearly a hundred. So of course, he wouldn't be alive anyway like at the state and so that is basically what we'll call the icebox murders. Oh see I've heard of that name, but I  I did not know any of that story. Yeah, I've heard the name to and I didn't really and I think the reason it really freaks me out is because imagine this like because I think when you start to read it or start to read about it, you just think this weirdo loner man living in his parents house and then he one day just like snaps and then kills his parents, but that is so and of course I left some of the details about what actually he did to the bodies, but that is like he didn't just kill them. He like mutilated their bodies he cut them up for sure.  Organs down the toilet chopped them up put them in the freezer because that is hatred, you know full-on planned out. Yeah, that would mean that there will some kind of motive. Yeah exactly. Like he obviously wasn't just human he snapped it was like something. Yeah. He didn't just say he's probably in their planning it and especially if it sounds like the parents were pretty toxic anyway, and maybe he just had enough I've had enough now, I'm going to get out of here and I think that's why it freaks me out that there's somebody that you could imagine somebody live with doing that and then think I'm  Part of it is so he was never found. So he managed to just escape and it's like something out of a movie where because they he just escaped to South America and then was like never seen again. That's crazy. Especially the fact that he was really successful. It wasn't that he lived at home and and never talk to anybody or never worked a day in his life or anything like very successful very intelligent and obviously very intelligent.  If he was able to escape and to not be found because I can't imagine how difficult that would be. Although I guess I mean in the in the 60s and 70s, it's a bit different but even still yeah exactly. I mean, I think it's probably easier to disappear back then obviously now, it's really probably a lot harder but it's still it's just I just found it really creepy just the idea of just the idea of him just being in that room and like slipping notes under the door didn't want to have anything to do with parents anyway, and the fact that the neighbors didn't even know that he was living there.  It was on. Can you imagine being those investigators though? Like that would traumatize you for the rest of your life? Yeah, you just open it open the door to the fridge and you see the heads in the crisper. Oh my God. No, but at least a year neither had 12. I'm like a long story. I know these feathers so they're sitting in a warehouse somewhere in Germany FedEx. Sorry, it's not funny. It's not funny.  Or I did a story and then I changed it because it wasn't right. So have you heard of the smiley face murders I've heard of oh, yes, but not not in depth. Yeah. Okay. So I'm gonna start off with a humble brag. So as you both know, I recently graduated with a criminology degree and for a social science degree. There was like a huge amount of Statistics with inner and something that a couple of people in my module groups really struggled with the understanding that just  Is two things are happening at the same time doesn't necessarily mean that they're connected or that they correlate in any way. So for example whilst like rainfall and wind shield wiper use would correlate finding a dead body in a river and there being a smiley face graffiti on the wall might not necessarily be connected, but for Kevin Gannon and Antony do art. I'm sorry, if I thought that who are retired and former NYPD detectives and legal.  Robertson who is a criminal justice Professor. There is a correlation between finding missing young white college-educated men in rivers and finding graffiti at the crime scene. Wow, when I like classic calling card. Yes. So when I first heard the story I was like bullshit but one of my late night deep dives into the internet Ganondorf and Gilbertson could have looked like quite compelling Theory and it verges on being a conspiracy theory which as you know, I enjoy  So they believe since 2008 some 40 cases have been mislabeled as accidental or undetermined drownings, but they're actually murders. Jeez. So since then their database of potential victims victims and suspicious drownings has risen to 355. They've added in additional physical evidence. And the first thing they say is D competently decomposition of these these bodies so they believe that some victims were missing for like a really long period of time  And some of them up to 40 days a year when their bodies are found the decomposition of them has only been like a few days like three days or two and a half days Gannon who I can't say the name Gannon without thinking of a video game Boss in Legend of Zelda life. So he's not Gannon or Gammon like the diamond Gannon. Okay. Yeah. So Gannon highlights lividity patterns, which is like how blood settles in a dead body lack of  Ting and the presence of insects which normally found on land which will indicate that these victims actually died on land or in the water the detectives the other two detectives do I think Gannon they highlight that there's often presence of GHB drug like the date rape drug in their systems in 99.9% of the victims. Yeah, interestingly. GHB is not often included in post-mortem toxicology tests really know so it's often.  Family of the victims for them to request that this test be undertaken or by the coroner or samples have been requested to be sent to this Trio for them to test for their research. So the outcome of this is basically they believe that these men are abducted murdered and then placed in the water. They want these deaths to be reclassified as homicides. And then their second priority is that they want to show that there is a link between them. So between all these murders for them and that link is  Is that there is often one of 13 symbols including a smiley face graffiti near the crime scene. So there's actually other symbols as well. Yeah, there's obviously been a huge rebuttals to this the FBI know they had quote not developed any evidence to support links between these tragic deaths or any evidence substantiating the theory that these deaths are the work of a serial killers and the vast majority of these instances appeared to be alcohol-related drowning and we live in like Southeast England in Kent and suddenly we see every now and then especially in the  Like young intoxicating than falling in a cold River and passing away the World Health Organization State their men are statistically more likely to die or be hospitalized from drowning and further that men are more likely to engage in Risky behaviors where the consuming alcohol or not. So like being like a dare of jumping in a river or, you know, having a little regard for their safety well on a lighter note, I mean just  Go on YouTube and you can see all the stupid videos of like men like yeah doing crazy stunts like jumping off a house into it. Whatever and you're right. Yeah, so there's actually been little physical evidence on the body is that the cases are anything but accidental drownings, so there's no blunt force trauma. There's no strangulation and there's no signs of torture and further that is called homicidal drowning. So when you physically drowns on one bike you want to kill them. It's very very rare. So dumping a body in  Doesn't wash away evidence. This is commonly believed dumping a body in cold water can actually preserve evidence such as wound patterns and it's pretty easy now to lift latent fingerprints from victim skins. So I know we talked about it in mind Hunter when we did our mind Hunter of you there. We talked about Wayne Williams who was convicted of the always believed to be responsible for the Atlanta child murders. So he's conviction was ultimately secured by Blood and fiber evidence.  Once obtained from bodies he jumped he dumped in a river. So that shows you like this cause you're dumping a body in River doesn't mean that all the evidence can be washed away and you know, you won't get caught and it just is not true. It doesn't happen. This smiley face graffiti being present is also being questioned. There's numerous photos of the faces spray-painted there are available and they're all different in style and start like size and the time frames different as well. Someone painted like a really long time ago. So I painted after the murders.  You think about it like graffiti spree like omnipresent everywhere? Yeah, and what's a common thing that you would graffiti on a wall like this something easy or a dick? Yeah. So that's a penis. We are just like giant pain. So the sensor for homicide research know in their 2010 research paper that this cheery graffiti is a cynical slap at the police by the vandals. So it's like quite a common a common thing for me. Yeah, so  So what do you think are these young white college-educated men falling and drowning rivers or is there something more Sinister? That's really tough? Because it does have the G8 all of them a lot of them having the GHB in their system. That's like a yeah. I mean I know that it can is also used as a recreational drug as well. Yeah, people take it. Yeah people just take yeah and also say if you re looking like little something and you're like gonna take a pill of someone you don't know what's in it. Yeah. Did you let him is in liquid form as  It so they'll build it and it's easy for somebody to put in a drink. I mean, I know that like near where we live like you mentioned you'll get especially around Christmas time. I think because people are out drinking in the waters really cold and we've had some of the drownings and fortunately in similar circumstance, but I do think it's just it's really okay. Maybe the smiley faces are stretched far too far, like maybe that's not you know, like you said two things can be happening, but they're not necessarily related but  But it does sound it just seems like a really high number of a very similar deaths unless that is just a truly common thing is it I don't yeah, I mean a lot of their figures come from the US and I'm saying the u.s. Is massive. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of people. Oh, yeah, what kind of like confuses me is that if there is no physical trauma to the body, so they're not if you say you had all these bodies washing up that look like they had been strangled. Okay, definitely something's going on there.  The fact that the body has like has nothing nothing except drowning like that seems hard to getting some of them do have some of them did have like injury to them. But I'm sure that could be believed to be that you know, so they hit their head and then stumbled into the river or you know, it's not yes, I think so. I personally believe it's a bit of a conspiracy theory. I think it sounds like a good you know, one of those good serial killer  the movies. Yeah, you kind of like I think it's really human to make sense of like a tragedy by believing that there is a conspiracy theory. Yeah. Thank you live with like if you live with uncertainty and like doubts pretty hard to like process. It's always easier to hold on to something else. Like it being a bigger. I think in grief that may be that there's a bigger picture or there's a bigger, you know that it's not the person the victims fault, you know, by being careless or it's just not a horrible thing that happened.  Is much easier I think to find blame and something else because there's a criminologist Scott Bond and he kind of notes that we seek to control what we fear and by believing in a conspiracy theory, it's kind of like protects you from the world around you it reduces everything to like us versus done and it lets you like pointer finger. It lets you blame someone you blame something and that's how people do a tragedy so I found that reading  Arresting hope you did too. I got my precious head. Yeah, there's a really good article on Rolling Stone were a lot more information came from about this and they actually Lincoln quite a lot of the like research papers that have been done by like the center for homicide research, which I read on it. So it's a really really good article and put links on the website. That's all I need I think as well if something starts to grow in terms of like a myth or a story or it gets publicity.  Are you hearing about like there's these smiley faces? Like I'm sure there's going to be people that will go out there and do them as like a copycat. They're not killing anybody or anything, but they're putting up these creepy smiley faces to be part of that sort of yeah story. Yeah. I definitely think you'll find that or it could just be as simple as what you said before. It's just something that when you know, when you're like doodling on like a little sheet of paper like you're on the phone you're like waiting on hold and something whatever.  Ever it's just a common thing you we travel even you know what? I mean? I don't know. It's just kind of one of those things like so who it could just be just trying too hard to connect these dots that aren't really you know there.  Alright guys, I guess that is kind of wraps it up for us.

It's every fold then raise the Scarlet standard high within its shade we live and I don't Hours Flinch and traitors sneer. We'll keep the red flag flying here.  Hello out there. It's a chilly Rainy Night in November 2019 in the swamps of South Carolina. We're a couple of generations into late capitalism fascism is on the rise and climate change Looms on the horizon like an Executioner's axe.  The limits of the two-party system and the institutions that have governed American society have been exposed as useless at best and designed to really marginalize and limit descent at worst. So Americans are looking for answers answers as to  Why things just never seem to get any better despite empty promises from really both sides of the aisle promises from Republicans and Democrats.  Like so many Americans, I believe that socialism is the answer. So let's talk about socialist theory for a moment socialist theory is a supposition or system of ideas intended to explain something especially one based on general principles independent of the thing that is being explained Praxis on the other hand is the General application or use of that theory under real-world conditions.  I'm so this podcast is going to take a little dive into some of the theory that informs our Praxis presented in an easy-to-understand and thoughtful way and hopefully get a good conversation going between myself and you The Listener we're going to be discussing texts from important historical figures and writers and thinkers Karl Marx Vladimir, Lenin and Mao Tse-tung Rosa Luxemburg Etc.  So stick around and let's learn together.  I'm CJ bones. This is the red banner.  So the first bit of theory we are going to talk about is Vladimir Lenin's the state and Revolution. So this first episode is going to deal with the preface and first chapter. So basically I'm going to be reading along with selected passages from this chapter and providing a little bit of context. So let's get to it. I'm  Making a Red Hook mothers of the sun raspberry Cezanne and getting comfortable. So, let's Dive Right In hmm. Here we go in the preface of the state and Revolution linen summarizes the political situation of late 1917 during that time. Russia was simultaneously in the middle of a socialist Revolution, but also,  dealing with the Fallout of World War One  So obviously most of the devastation of World War 1 fell upon the backs of the working class who had to not only topple the Russian monarchy but also fight off Invasion from Germany and her allies at the time and the world really had never seen such man-made destruction on such a large scale before indeed World War 1 introduced entirely new methods of warfighting such as the deployment of chemical weapons the introduction of trench warfare mechanized Infantry.  And so on and linen describe such developments as quote the unprecedented Horrors and miseries of the protracted War. He goes on to say that whores are quote making the people's position unbearable and increasing their anger. So he establishes what I see as a direct connection between those internal and external stress forces and the development of a revolutionary proletariat.  Yet however the path towards revolution in early 20th century. Russia was not always a smooth one. And I think that's a theme we will continue to come back to throughout this text and probably throughout this podcast Lynn discusses The Perils of what he calls social chauvinism fairly early in the preface women describes social chauvinism as quote socialism in words and chauvinism in Deeds. So what  I interpreted Linens meaning behind the word chauvinism is essentially irrational patriotism particularly during wartime in support of One's Own nation state versus other nation states, although chauvinism is mostly associated with right-wing of most social movements at the time many socialists also moved away from their anti militaristic stance and their belief in an international proletariat.  Chauvinism and warmongering saber-rattling and nationalism etcetera. So Lennon sites a few examples of this from the time period specifically organizations like the German Social Democratic party and French Socialist Party. He points out the that such chauvinism is the threat to the international struggle of the proletariat. So I think it's  it's safe to say or safe to infer here that a socialist society cannot be achieved without a sense of shared Destiny and camaraderie amongst the global working class, which is critical to challenge the money power resources. And in many ways Unity of the ruling class part of promoting this sense of shared Destiny and purpose.  Takes the form of pushing back against revisionism that is to say a struggle against the opportunist prejudices concerning the state linen identify as other writers and thinkers within the left Pantheon such as Karl kautsky as particularly in egregious at pushing this line of thought.  So that's another name. We're going to see more than once here in this episode as the preface comes to a close.  I'll let in sets up some of the key discussion points that appear throughout the book placed within this historical context that we discussed earlier the frames the question of the world right worldwide proletariat Revolution as quote the most urgent problem of the day unquote and the purpose of the book as quote explaining to the masses what they will have to do before long to free themselves from capitalist. Tyranny. I think this is a really good.  I have kind of tying it all together and getting into the meat of the text. So that was the preface of Linens the state and Revolution will take a short break and then we're going to get back into the first chapter and the first section of that chapter, which is called a product of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms, or I'm sorry the state  the product of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms  I'm CJ bones. This is the red banner.  Welcome back.  So here we go into Section 1 of chapter one, which is called the state a product of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms. Take a little sip of my Red Hook here mothers of the sea raspberry Cezanne and let's get to it.  Maybe it's weird that I'm talking about. What kind of beer that I'm drinking during a socialist Theory podcast, but I like beer so fight me. I don't know. All right, here we go. Linen Begins the first section of the chapter by making a comparison between Marxist theory and the life stories of revolutionaries throughout the world up until that point. I feel so makes a direct link in what he  These as the weakening or diluting of Marxist theory to how emancipatory figures throughout human history are essentially canonized and made both larger and than life but also less than human. So there's a lot of subtlety a lot of nuance and a lot of real human death that is Stripped Away From A lot of these revolutionary figures and I'll quote here a little bit from the text.  Quote attempts are made to convert them into harmless icons into hallo their names to a certain extent while at the same time robbing the Revolutionary theory of its substance blunting its revolutionary Edge.  So quick sidebar here. I think a good example here in the United States might be Martin Luther King Jr. Who was transformed into a staunch anti-war activist and friend to the unions in the sort of a guess for lack of a better term a pacifist liberal sink.  Martin Luther King jr. Is presented in far too many textbooks without any criticism of the systemic failures of capitalism when included at all so back to the text then focuses his criticism and on the labor movement of the time observing that opportunists and Bourgeois Z within the movement are essentially following a toothless version of Marxist theory without ebony any revolutionary soul and goes on to suggest that  It's a distorted version of Marxist theory does not have the theoretical underpinnings to seriously confronted P realist Wars or avoid the slide into extreme nationalism.  So given these circumstances LED and quickly moves to establish the main goal of the text, which is getting back to the basics of Marxist theory and to avoid the distortions of what he calls kautsky ISM at its core Marxist. Theory says that a nation that nation-states exist because of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms at the same time the  Since of that state proves the class antagonisms are in fact irreconcilable.  So we'll pull up a little bit from the text here. The state is an organ for the oppression of one class by another it is the creation of quote order unquote which legalizes and perpetuates this oppression by moderating the conflict between classes in the opinion of the petty Bourgeois politicians. However order means the reconciliation of classes and not  Not the oppression of one class by another.  Linen sites the menshevik position during the Russian Revolution of 1917 to back this point up which was still very much in full swing at the time. So another brief aside here men should exit along with Bolsheviks were two factions of the Socialist movement in Russia during the early 20th century an important difference here is that mensheviks were more inclined to work with liberal Bourgeois Democratic parties such as the Constitutional Democrats to  Socialism and overthrow the czarist regime other faction Bolsheviks believe that constitutional Democrats were not radical enough and could not lead a socialist Revolution. They also believed that armed struggle would be the most effective way to go through the monarchy as opposed to say the strategies like empowering trade unions and other more legal methods, which were favored.  and metrics  when ends the first section by reiterating the following hypothesis  If the state is the product the irreconcilability of class antagonisms, if it is a power standing above society and alienating itself more and more from it. It is clear that the liberation of the oppressed class is impossible not only without a violent revolution, but also without the destruction of the apparatus of state power which which created during which was created by the ruling class and which is the embodiment of this.  Alienation so that pretty much wraps up the first section of chapter 1 next we will get into the section the second section of chapter one known as special bodies of armed men prisons Etc. Most of the section gets into criticisms of a very specific.  Cific type of state power and that is the power that comes from the end of a gun Linens shares a quote from Frederick Engels here that will frame much of the observations later on in the section.  There's a quote.  As distinct from the old tribal or Clan order. So he's talking about like Prius 3. Basically the state first divides its subjects according to territory. The second distinguishing feature is the establishment of a public power which no longer directly coincides with the population organizing itself as an armed Force. The special Public Power is necessary because a self  Acting armed organization of the population has become impossible since the split into classes this Public Power exists in every state. It consists. Not merely of armed men. But also of material adjuncts prisons and institutions of origin of all kinds of which tribal or Clan Society knew nothing when then goes on to summarize the quote by stating like already.  Ellucian are thinkers Engels tries to draw the attention of the class conscious workers to what prevailing give us T nism regards as least worthy of attention a standing army and police of the chief instruments of state power. And I think this is really important to emphasize will say that again a standing army and police are the chief instruments of state power.  Linen notes that indeed a self-acting armed organization of workers is a foreign concept for most people at the time and I think it's probably not unreasonable to say that it's still a foreign concept for folks here in the United States in 2019, but that doesn't cancel out the fact that Society is still split into these antagonistic classes and because of that split into antagonist two classes organizing into armed groups of workers.  Would lead into an armed struggle between them. So essentially take all that off the table these so-called special parties of armed men act as an apparatus to oppress the proletariat in favor of the in favor of the Bourgeois. See it's a lot harder organized if there's a cop on every corner.  It is critical when it says to instead create a new kind of armed organization made up of the proletariat capable of quote serving be exploited instead of the exploiters.  Obviously in 1917 and again in 2019 this concept of organizing armed groups for at First Mutual defense and invention and eventually to advance Revolution activity is generally it's not something that a lot of folks on the left talk about but nothing's for certain right nothing lasts forever. And there's no reason to believe this trend will continue indefinitely Linden takes note of such potential development.  By quoting Ingles sing something along the same lines.  quote the Public Power grows stronger, however, in proportion as class antagonisms within the state become more acute and as adjacent States become larger and more populous, we have only to look at our present day Europe or class struggle and rivalry and Conquest have turned up the public power to such a pitch that it threatens to swallow the whole of society and even the state  Lynn puts this quote in the context for the follow-up quote the turn towards imperialism meaning the complete domination of the truss the omnipotence of the big Banks a grand scale Colonial policy and so forth was only just beginning in France who is even weaker in North America and in Germany, and remember the work from angles that linen is referring to here was written in the late 1800s. So this is like late 19th early 20th century. This is all  All kind of the groundwork for the Russian Revolution and I think of a lot of revolutionary activity of the time this section is wrapped up with what I think is a sober assessment of the state of early 20th century imperialism.  sorry early 20th century imperialism with the following quote since then rivalry in Conquest has taken a gigantic stride all the more because by the beginning of the second decade of the 20th century the world had been completely divided up among the great predatory great Powers since then military and Naval armaments have grown fantastically the predatory war of  10:14 to 1917 for the domination of the World by Britain or Germany or the this division of the spoils has brought in the swallowing of all forces of society by the rapacious state power close to complete catastrophe the quote continues.  Angles could as early as 1891 point to quote rivalry in Conquest unquote as one of the most important distinguishing features of the foreign policy of the great Powers while the social chauvinist Scoundrels have ever since 1914 when this rivalry many time intensified gave rise to an imperialist war and he's talking about World War one here. Obviously. I've been covering up the defense of predatory interest of Their Own.  Who's YZ with phrases about defense of the Fatherland defense of the Republic and the revolution Etc.  So that'll wrap up section 2 we're going to take a short break and move on to section 3 and 4 of the first chapter, so  I'm going to grab another beverage and join you here in a little bit. Enjoy the music. This is CJ bones. This is the red banner.  Welcome back. So we're going to get into Section 3 of my Tamir Linens the state and Revolution. So this third chapter is called the state an instrument for the exploitation of the oppressed class. So in this section, we start to see lemon talk about linking the previous two sections together the irreconcilability of class difference on  Hand and the police military and other armed extensions of the ruling class on the other. So most obvious here is the observation that in order for this arrangement to work and not immediately erupt into armed Revolt the state must be seen as legitimate to clarify the quote that linen uses is above Society specifically, but I'd like to add the word legitimate for our discussion here shifting back to American politics for a moment.  Obviously the 2016 election is the biggest recent example of how broken our system is, but it's definitely not the only example rampant gerrymandering the rolling back of voting rights by instituting strict ID policies the Strategic lack of resources and polling locations for predominantly POC neighborhoods, the passage of citizens united in the Supreme Court in 2010 and the Fallout from the highly contested election in 2000 all point to A system that is clearly designed.  To limit Choice disenfranchised millions and keep the ruling class in power despite their continued to unpopularity. So we see over and over again these emotional and irrational appeals to patriotism to keep from to keep folks from looking beyond the Overton window. We're seeing a doubling down of chauvinistic language as a flight from the right and they're liberal enablers as they fight with each other to prove who loves Daddy America the most  although the group's may have different talking points and certainly look different. They often use similar appeals to the military the police and to some amorphous sense of national identity to get their message out. And that message is this vote for our people. We love America more than they do we know what is best for America. They just want to destroy America.  So such language and arguments begin from a flawed hypothesis. The United States has a moral is a moral good in the world. The United States is The Shining City on the hill that continues to bring freedom and democracy to an often scary and unjust world, but the foundation moral goodness can be only accepted if you know folks buy into the idea or at least if they're willing to defend that idea with violence that the United States has a legitimate right to dictate to the rest.  The world what is good just and Democratic when it is failed to live up to those ideas over and over again since day one the truth is much more simple, the ruling class draws material political and social benefits from the fact that this country was built on the blood and labor of millions of indigenous and enslaved human beings. It continues to draw that wealth upward through methods, like union-busting mass incarceration discriminatory banking.  practices environmental racism and other methods  It's designed with the purposes of steadily funding funneling wealth upward away from the public area reproduce that both in the first place.  It's a scam promoted by and protected by folks who want to keep that scam going regardless. They're Republican or Democrat back to the text here linen continues to discuss the theory of the state being above Society. He cites Frederick Engels once more.  Because the state arose from the need to hold class antagonisms and check but because it arose same time in the midst of the conflict of these classes. It is as a rule the state of the most powerful economically dominant class which through the medium of the state becomes also the politically dominant class and thus acquires new means of holding down and exploiting the oppressed glass. Does that sound familiar angles continues?  the modern representative state is an instrument of exploitation of wage labor by Capital by way of exception however periods occur in which the warring classes balance each other so nearly the state power as a sensible mediator acquires for the moment a certain degree of independence of both and linens sites European monarchies of the 17th and 18th centuries the first and second Bonaparte empires in France, and the  Regime in Germany as examples, but I don't think it's much of a stretch to see how this kind of arrangement works out in the United States in 2019. One doesn't have to dig deep to find examples of Buchwald Representatives happily doing the bidding of private Equity firms and pharmaceutical companies rather than actually serving the folks that put them in office in the first place. You don't have to watch the news for a long time to see how militarized police will violently attack protesters with impunity all in the name of protecting privacy.  Your property which was built with exploited labor on Stolen land.  back to the text once born we take a sip linen uses a critical lens to examine the karinski government and Republican Russia when it began to turn against the revolutionaries blaming the leadership of what he calls petty petty Bourgeois Democrats and in Democratic Republic angles continues wealth exercises power indirectly, but all the more surely first by means of the direct Corruption of officials, and he uses the United States as an example here and then  Only by means of an alliance of the government and the stock exchange in which he uses an example of France and the us here.  One passage that I find particularly helpful. Here is the quote that the Democratic Republic is the best possible political shell for capitalism. And therefore once capitalism has gained possession of this very best. Shell it establishes its power so securely so firmly that no change of persons institutions are parties in the Bourgeois Democratic Republic can shake it.  When in paints a damning picture of electoral ISM here and honestly, I think this is something that many folks on the left. Don't talk nearly enough about  In 2019 organizations like the Democratic socialists of America are doing a good job at getting folks talking about socialism and myself included and Thinking Beyond the narrow political party Obsession. So common here in the United States. However, when a lot of folks in organizations like DSA and other leftist groups in the United States start to get into deeper Dives on Theory quote no attempt is made to gauge the breadth and depth of the Revolution that this relegating of the whole Machinery of the state.  It to a museum of Antiquities implies in most cases. We do not even find an understanding of what angles calls the state machine. So I think this is something that we can and should improve upon. Otherwise this entire discussion becomes about hypotheticals and not about tangible measurable results. So that's the end of Section 3. We are going to move on to section for the withering away of the state and violent revolution. I'm going to share most of  the quote from angles that linen sites here as it's pretty important to understanding the entire basis on what marxist-leninist theory is built on top of the proletariat ceases from State power and turns the means of production if the state property to begin with but there by it abolishes itself as the proletariat abolishes all class distinctions and class antagonisms and abolishes. Also the state as state Society thus far operating  Mid class antagonisms needed the state that is an organization of the particular exploiting class for the maintenance of its external conditions of production and therefore especially for the purpose of forcibly keeping the exploited class in the conditions of Oppression determined by the given mode of production. That would be slavery serfdom or bondage or wage labor here. The state was the official representative of society as a whole its concentration in a visible Corporation.  But this was only insofar as it was the state of that class which itself represented for its own time society as a whole in ancient times the state of slave-owning citizens in the middle ages of the feudal nobility in our own time of the Bush, Rossi.  When at last it becomes the real representative of the whole of society, it renders itself unnecessary. As soon as there is no longer any social class to be held in subjection as soon as class rule in the individual struggle for existence based on the present Anarchy in production with the collisions and excesses arising from the struggle are removed. Nothing more remains to be held in subjection. Nothing necessitating a special course at force a state the First Act by which  which the state really comes forward as the representative of the whole of society that taking possession of the means of production in the name of society is also its last independent act as the state state interference in Social relations becomes in one domain after another Superfluous then dies down on itself.  The government of persons is replaced by the administration of things and by the conduct of processes of production. The state is not abolished it Withers away.  So that was a pretty big quote. Let's get into it letting defines the withering away of the state as separate and distinct from his view of the intercoastal approach which is to abolish the state quickly and not seize the power that state. However, we must also note that there is a distinct separation between the idea of a velocity State a poet Aryan state was to be abolished and what Withers away we'll get into that shortly.  When it provides what most would consider a somewhat Orthodox view of Marxism here Drawing the Line in the Sand against opportunism and against slow gradual reform is mmm this interpretation. He says quote only leaves a vague notion of a slow even gradual change of absence of bleep sandstorms an absence of Revolution the current widespread popular for one may say so conception of the withering away of the state undoubtedly means of securing if not,  UDA Ting Revolution  Lenin again site singles to clear things up here.  Engel speaks here of the proletariat Revolution abolishing the Bourgeois State while the words about the state withering away refer to the remnants of the proletarian state after the Socialist Revolution according to angles. The bhujbal state does not wither away but is abolished by the proletariat in the course of the Revolution what Withers away after this revolution is the proletarian state for semistate.  So when it doesn't mince words here, he doesn't speak in vague utopian missives. This book presents a sober-minded realistic assessment of what it will take to win this thing.  Another quote here. The state is a special course of force and from it follows that the special horse of forest from the suppression of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie of millions of working people by handfuls of the rich must be replaced by a special course of force for the suppression of the bourgeoisie by the proletariat the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is precisely what is meant by the abolition of the state as State. This is precisely the act of taking possession of the means of production in the name of  Towards the end of this final section of the first chapter linen digs into Engels argument for the significance of violent revolution and notes how these types of arguments and discussions aren't very common in socialist organizations from 1970 not to mention 2019 linen then emphasizes that the idea of violent revolution is forever linked with the withering away of the state violent revolution. According to the quote from Ingalls is the Midwife of every old society, which is pregnant with a new one.  That is the instrument with Which social movement forces its way through and shatters the dead fossilized political forms being realistic about the Revolutionary process and not abandoning it to obsessions over Party politics or eclecticism is a central tenet of Marxist theory plan argues and the rise of Social chauvinists and followers of folks like cats key is in his view of betrayal of that theory.  So through careful scientific study of existing Revolutions of the time and he cites the Paris commune of 1871 as an example when in concludes that the movement from a usual state into a proletarian state is impossible without violent revolution following that the abolition of the proletarian state is impossible except for the process of withering away as a state itself becomes ever more Superfluous and unnecessary.  This ends chapter 1 of Linens the state and Revolution join me next time when we get into chapter 2 entitled the experience of 1848 through 1851.

              "   \"The following program contains discussion of real-life law enforcement situations in may include graphic content and adult language listener discretion is advised.  Welcome to end to watch with booty and sap where your host Kevin Grogan and Louisville ocon on topics that affect the law enforcement community and invite guests who have their fingers on the pulse of our nation over 40 years of combined law enforcement experience ranging from Patrol to multi-million dollar Federal investigations. We are not going to pull any punches.  That's welcome to another edition of End of Watch with boots and Sal he slew of alosi a case Al Kevin Grogan AK Bootsy. All right boots. What are we talking about today? What's the topic? Well a couple of days ago, you know, they had the democratic debate or the candidates and good old Beto O'Rourke a former Congressman decided he was going to tell us that you know me.  Considerations that hell yes, he's going to take our AR-15s and our AK-47s and we've discussed a bunch of times man. I'm not a I'm not a gun stroke. Not a big gun guy, don't you not the biggest fan. However, just my Common Sense makes me ask mr. O'Rourke. How exactly do you practically plan to implement that plan. Yeah. So a lot of these seemingly cop, huh?  Hating politicians are going to get the cops to take away law-abiding citizens guns. I want to see that play out and I tell you what, I'm going to we've talked about this before but before we really get into it neither boots you nor I are really political people. This is not a political podcast this a law enforcement podcast. Neither one of us are registered to either  30 however, I actually tried to watch some of that debate and I don't know what these Democrats are thinking. I just can't even relate with the mindset. It's almost like a like the latest episode of I hate America with these people there was not one American flag on that stage. What is going on with the I hate America?  The sentiment and they're running for president of the United States the mishnah one American play. The thing is man when I listen to individuals and in this case the Democratic party, but when I listen to them discuss, you know any of these things and I can never figure out where they're coming from never liked have they put any thought behind any of the things that they're saying and I really think they've kind of lost touch with reality you can be  Bro, and you can be a Democrat by all me and still love your country and be proud of the country that gave you everything we have in the opportunity to speak your mind like you do but I don't see any of that. And again, I don't want to get off course. It's not a political show and again boots and I are not probabl members of either party what holy cow and then Beto stands up and says, yes, if elected president he  We'll take away our AR-15s in our AK-47s now unlike booty. I am a gun guy. I'm a big-time gun guy and I'm a huge Second Amendment fan. I'm a huge Constitution fan. And he recognized that there is a Second Amendment of the Constitution and and stuff. My objection to guns is not political. It's just I've seen, you know way too much of what they do, you know, and that is mostly you know, I don't blame the weapon. I don't say  The guns from everybody but I also don't say let's arm everybody. That's the solution. You know, it's not a that's not the thing. It's just you know guns are designed to kill and my biggest concern is with the people who don't follow the rules who don't play, you know, don't follow the law and go out and hurt you that's it in so when a guy like O'Rourke gets up there and he's talking about and then later he was on another talk show. I think it was Meet the Press.  Or whatever it was he went and you know continue would not break from the course. He's saying, you know when you have a 17 month old baby shot in the face in Odessa, Texas, and I don't know anybody that would disagree that that's a terrible thing. But that is not the weapon. It is not the instruments problem. That is society's problem. It's the guy the individual who  Mitad that act that's the problem. Okay. So you're going to take all these ar-fifteens. Your SKS is your ak-forty since all your different variants? Okay. Let's assume he's talking about everything and I love when he uses again the term assault weapon. He doesn't know the definition of that term and the other thing is is if you're thinking about it that way if I take a 38 caliber  evolver no matter what brand it is and I shoot somebody with it. That's an assault weapon by my turn. You know, it's not it's not the weapon itself. It doesn't he got into high-capacity rounds and all that kind of good. Now you're talking about a completely thing is you're not talking about the weapon anymore. You're talking about the ammunition and that's these guys get up here with no knowledge of weapons, you know the nomenclature or  Thing that poor gun laws. They have no knowledge of the laws that are on the way to get it. I don't even want to get into that. I mean why I write more I don't think we could fit any more gun laws. I'm sure they would be as ineffective as the ones that we have. Now. It's just the the issue is the enforcement of it and then the adjudication, you know, I don't think there should be misdemeanor gun crimes. I think it's that serious. I think that that might be one of the solutions  it's okay. If you show in any way that you cannot carry a weapon in a long by, you know in Georgia used to be carrying a concealed weapon right now. It's carrying a weapon without a license. If you get caught doing any of those things, it doesn't take much to get a license in Georgia doesn't take much, you know to comply with that law. But if you show that you're not going to comply with it, that's no little think we are.  Here's where we disagree booty because I don't believe any state has the right to put any conditions on a law-abiding citizens possession and carrying of a firearm. There is a second amendment and this second amendment limits any and all governments from being able to deny a lot of Abiding Citizen the right to bear a firearm. So I don't believe that any state any City any municipality should be able  To put any kind of limitations on what our second amendment gives us our right to carry firearms. If you are a law abiding citizen like old Ted Nugent says the Second Amendment is my concealed weapon permit and edit. I believe in the Armament of every law-abiding citizen and I think that if you are if you are law-abiding citizen and you don't have a gun and you don't know how to use a gun, you're a fool ouch. Yeah.  I don't I don't because it guns are out there if the there is no out of the tube man and it's never going back in there more guns in there are people in America. Yeah, the guns are out there. So in there's no doubt about that. You can see well maybe you know, you know, if we the guns will go away. They're never going away too bad guys will always have that even if we stopped manufacturing them today. Absolutely it would have how the only thing about that is you and I both know it and whether I agree disagree with that.  We do have laws that say that you are required to have a permit to carry that firearm in Georgia. Right and there are other states that have that same law. My thing is that laws in place. I don't have a problem with that law being in place because it kind of helps differentiate between folks. You have to go through a screening and that kind of stuff in order to obtain that permit. So it makes it more difficult or convicted felons to obtain weapons through legal means, you know, it's one more  Fertile, they have to go to even though you and I both know from our professional experience that it's not the only way they can obtain weapons is not it's actually not the first thing they're going to try even straw purchase is not the person you they're going to go to the black market. They're going to find stolen weapons and that kind of however what I'm saying is if people show that they can't comply with those very simple laws get a permit with it 75 bucks get a permit Carry Your Weapon  Okay, play by the rules. As soon as you step outside of that that to me is not a misdemeanor anything to do with Firearms is not a misdemeanor brandishing a weapon in public. That's not a misdemeanor in my eyes. It is in the Georgia state laws and I'm sure it is in other, you know, the difference between brandishing a weapon and pointing a weapon at another there's all these different misdemeanor laws. I don't think any of those are misdemeanor. That's very circumstantial though. You can't put a blanket on that I mean again,  It's going to be a case-by-case, you know, what does in person threatened? I you know, I don't believe there's no government body that has should have the power to put any limitations on our constitutional rights. And that's what exactly these states and city governments are doing but they act as a constitutional right, right exactly, but it done it and going back how how long disagree with it, but I strongly disagree with a lot of things to do but what's next. I mean I now are they going to start can a state curtail speech next well,  They're either going to be detailed and now, you know, my rights against need a license to go to church exactly and I don't have to start wearing helmets in cars soon crash helmets, you know my right our rights against warrantless searches and seizures. Are they going to start infringing on those LF? You don't have anything if you don't have a exemption then you wind up I see where you're going with that. So let's just let's keep you.  Well, go ahead go get back to bed. Oh, but see if you agree with this. There are enough gun laws in place. Yes that if we enforce them strictly we could help curtail gun by that's a beautiful segue into into my statement, which is my theme for this. So I am all for the confiscation of firearms beta I am I am in favor of the government confiscating Firearms, I believe.  All firearms should be confiscated from those people in this country who are not legally allowed to have a firearm. I'm okay start with them. Well, let's start and finish with them. We cannot confiscate guns from law-abiding citizens. Now, there's not enough ATF agents out there. There's less than 2000. This is what I did for my whole career. There's not enough state officers and local officers to even go out there. I don't care how many task forces you.  And get all the guns off the streets out of the hands of people who are prohibited from having. No when I say prohibited. I mean that class of US citizens and non-citizens, you know residents who are convicted felons who have been convicted of a crime of domestic violence who are illegally in this country and there's a whole list that falls under Title 18 USC 922 G that list everyone who  Is and some of them are very rarely encountered, you know, if you've denounce your citizenship, you know, if you've been adjudicated as a mental defective to include drug addicts, yep drug addicts. So let's let's confiscate the guns which is atf's job, which is what I did but less than 2,000 agents in a country of I don't know how many people where there are easily tens of thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of  Did people in this country who have guns let's go get those guns and that first by doing that not first. That's it by doing that you are going to see crime and violent crime reduced drastically. So let's forget about the drug war. The failed drug war. Let's forget about let's go after convicted felons armed drug dealers, you know people who have been adjudicated mental defectives. Let's go after them and get their guns.  Off the streets and maybe you're a little more optimistic now and I think we're saying the same thing but when I say, let's go do that first brought to your liver. You're a liberal gun hater and I'm gonna straighten Second Amendment Champion, but go ahead. I forgot right? Let's go get the guns from those guys. And when that's when that is when that mission is accomplished, then we can talk about all these other things. However, you and I there's no talk about well the Second Amendment would what's there to talk about?  Once that is accomplished. Once we got all the guns from the bad guys, but it's never going to happen is going to be a new crew of bad guys. It's never gonna happen is cyclical. It's never is never going to happen is is my point. There's no chance that however, we need to make that the priority not how is disarming the law-abiding citizen helping the problem. It is not exactly my point when we disarm the law-abiding populace what we do is we create  Eight targets we create targets of opportunity for those in our society who will prey on people who are vulnerable and if you take these will you don't need an AR-15 to hunt? No, I don't need an AR-15 done. But I sure as hell need it to defend my home from those prohibited people that we were referring. Are you referring to just minute e absolute and you know, those know those guys don't give a shit with the law says and pardon my language that hurts failed, but they don't  Here about whatever your rules are. Whatever your laws are they will do whatever they need to do because they're predatory. That's how they operate and that's how they live and unfortunately and I don't know mr. O'Rourke personally, but I'm starting to think that he has no clue that those people truly exist in our country and they do and you and I've dealt with them for years. Yeah. Actually I think beta would be a prohibited person if he if he had gotten a conviction on that burglary arrests.  He had but again, you know, we're talking about the gun permits and you know here in Georgia where we live. I will tell you one thing that a positive I see from the gun permit working in a gun store here locally. I would say maybe roughly 60% of the people coming in that I see to buy guns have a Georgia permit and that speeds up the process right absolute so I can come in with my Georgia permit.  No purchase a firearm show you my thing. So you already know that I've been screened and I'm a lot, you know this I meet all the we still have to fill out a 4473 which is kept on record. But that which you can sell is no me because the account of a crunch and the County government is already he's already on that work for you. That's right. It's one more thing to go. Absolutely and I like to see I'm seeing women coming in and they have their concealed weapon permits. I'm seeing all ethnicities coming in, you know guy.  guys, I'm speaking to in Spanish or in there all sorts of soldiers who are stationed here whites blacks Hispanics Asians, everyone coming in with concealed weapon permits and they're all law-abiding citizens and good Americans in their exercising their Second Amendment, right and there are farm and I love it and they're purchasing these firearms for recreation Home Defense target shooting home defense is the biggest reason self-defense and self-defense is absolutely the thing I mean,  The world we live in today owning a firearm. I don't like guns. Like I said and I'll say it again and I'll keep saying it. I'm not a member of the NRA and that kind of stuff. However, I do own firearms. I do carry guns. I believe in protecting not only myself but you know my family and my friends what I can't remember who it was if it was Charlton has her someone had said, it would be a great world if guns didn't exist.  Right. Yes, but what a great world, but they do it's reality. Right? I mean, it'd be a great world if mosquitoes didn't exist. If Cara didn't exist is that would be a great thing. However, that's not the world we live. No and I think that is the danger of when a guy who is aspiring to be the president of the United States gets up and says something and I'll call it ridiculous like we're coming and we're going to take your way you're taking an aggressive stance with law-abiding.  Citizens in the country. Yeah. Yeah and you're afraid to take that same stance with I'd love to sit down with that guy and talk to him about how we're going to clean it how we're going to take care of the violent crime in Chicago. Yeah. What is the plan for Chicago? Once you've disarmed the law-abiding citizens of Chicago? What are you going to do to the other free-for-all? Do you ever see the purge? Yeah, it'll be at 365 days a year The Purge. I just don't know I would love to sit down with.  With O'Rourke Irish guy and he's talked to him about gun laws. I'd love to know if he has any knowledge of the gun laws of what's on the books, you know, and I would guarantee that he does not probably doesn't have a absolutely and I don't think he cares him. You know, he's got he's got this rhetoric. They can come out and say we're going to call me and he thinks he's going to cash in on the  The gun control thing you're not going to get elected president that way man. Now there's so many more Americans and whether they're a gun stroke or not, which I again I am not but I believe in our Second Amendment you're a believing already amendments to the Constitution that you're never with your if your solution to the gun problem, you're coming out of the block saying let's take away rifles from law-abiding citizens. That's how you're coming out of the blocks. You got a lot to learn.  It's just not let's take it a step further. Okay into the Practical realm of this man gets elected. He goes in this is his platform and he says he's going to come who the hell are you going to get your going to have a gun buyback program stuff like that at some point they're going to stop coming in with their weapons. They will have sold them all. Okay. Now, what do you do?  You going to go get the rest of them if you even try there will be a revolution and and that there will be a revolution if you even try as exactly what we need to eat to even suggest that yep in the second you take any overt or practical step we going you will create a revolution in this country. There's no there's no question about and what you're doing is you're turning law-abiding citizens into your enemy. Yes. It's exactly what is no other. There's no other way.  To look at it, you're taking people who obey the law follow the law and because you want to spread this rhetoric you are going to turn that populace against you doesn't seem like a sound idea in Boots his mindset. Yeah, it worries me. Well, what's next? I think that whole group up there basically felt that way. I don't maybe Biden doesn't but I you know, I don't know if any of them really disagree.  With him, like you said, I don't think they had the balls to say it. No. No, I'll give him credit for having some a set of stones on them enough to stand up there and say it but you know what with that audience in front of that audience in that crowd, you know, he was going to get Applause. You can say through radical like that for me any and that response fuels his fire to go and say more dumb things. I mean, I don't know another way that to describe that mindset. But again,  You know unlike unlike the drug war the failed drug war, right? We've been fighting a drug war for over three decades. We've lost. Okay a degree unlike the drug war the War on Drugs. We can control the gun problem in America that is controllable. And the way to do that is give up, you know the this this War on Drugs we have to divert that money into  The gun problem. Okay. Beef up ATF  give money for task Force's for ATF agents state officers local officers go out and Target armed violent criminals. Okay, that's where you start arm. The trigger pullers start with them you go out systematically in every city in this country systematically start taking them out and make examples of them. Is that attractive? Is that a practical thing that could be implemented? Is that something that  I think we could could really do I do so do I and you know why I think that because we both done it. Yeah, exactly. It's a very practical as opposed to let's start with the let's start with these gun buybacks and there's no way that ends who's going to fund that who's you know, where's all that money going to come from? Who's going to do it now. Now what you're talking about has been done and does his successful. The the problem is it's not sustain. No, it's not. It's  Never sustained and you know here operation between agencies is a problem, right FBI DEA ATF Homeland Security because everybody wants credit, right and they want the end they want their ideas better. So they want to get budget and that's got to go out the door. There's got to be cooperation between the feds the state and the locals. Well, I'm going to hit you with a quote. Go ahead from President. Harry S Truman great great, man. Imagine what we could accomplish if we were  Worried about who got credit for holy shit. Can you believe that cats a great man? I read, you know lock stops here. It's unbelievable, man, if people would stop if it wasn't an FBI thing or yeah, you know my and closing name of the plane that bombed Hiroshima booty the Enola Gay. There's just some that was random trivia. Go ahead. You know, Harry said he never lost a night's sleep over that because he knew he saved more lives and he ended up.  Taking it's a terrible thing war is a terrible thing but on net unfortunately in that thing, they weren't anyway whole of the top. Yeah, go ahead. But like I said, my problem was always with our local DEA and that's nothing against the DEA nationally, but you know, the whole thing was well who's going to you who's going to spearhead this whose name is going to be on this was going to be at the podium write a press release who gives a damn. Let's get the guns on the table is going to  Year in the asset forfeiture and all that cry like this. Oh and there's a huge problem in law enforcement is where's this going to go? What's that going to go when you got to keep in mind? What are we trying to accomplish the what we're trying to accomplish is get the guns away from the bad guys. If the ATF bought dope to achieve, you know, the Tactical success of getting guns have been so bad. If you need help, you know, right who would want to get in the way of that and then I'll and a lot of those problems that you're talking about also.  So maybe the majority come directly from the United States attorney's office and the District Attorney's Office though. Go ahead boy, but know what you're saying is exactly what if we actually had cooperation. We just need politicians Congress to get serious about addressing the problem addressed the gun problem and I don't mean law-abiding citizens possessing guns. I mean the gun problem in America criminals.  Prohibited persons in possession of firearms. That is the gun problem in America. Someone needs to say that I don't know why anyone hasn't stood up and said say that put me on the news. I'll say it doesn't that's a gun to say America. It really doesn't save animals with guns. It doesn't take a lot of guts to say it. It's true. It's undeniable, you know irrefutable. There's no you can't argue that people get killed by criminals. You know, what do people get killed with firearms?  Eames in domestic situations. Yes, they do. However, they get killed with knives. Also, they put it downstairs. They get strangled. They get are you know, all of those things still happen? There's a fire and make it easy Otto relies. The Sara Lee autoerotic has been addressed. I never mind. Yeah, let's pause over explosion that when I get a break those syllables down a lot of but all of those things like you said the War on Drugs has failed. Yeah, unfortunately because the thing is  With that you're dealing with addicts you're dealing with mental health you're dealing at all of these things and they can go in so many different there's for a lack of better supporter for lack of a better term. There are so many excuses for that. There is no excuse for gun violence. No, none don't care. I it's it's inexcusable for one human to take a weapon and impose their will on another  It's just there's no if I violently, you know, overtake whatever situation because I have a firearm that's never going to be the right thing ever and they're suicidal intent mind you with criminal anything it can happen if it can't so I saw a problem solved during my tenure with ATF in the late 90s, very early 2000s. Domestic gun. Trafficking was a huge problem. Okay guns were coming from Source States.  And going to Target States and being used in crimes. Okay, an example would be like, Georgia to New York, Georgia to New York Georgia. Is this Source State very easy to to acquire a firearm New York is a target State very difficult to acquire a firearm. So then you have supply and demand do the graph. So in a source data guns going to be cheap to get in a Target State. It's going to be expensive. Okay, so the bad guys would come to Georgia Unfortunately they came  in all forms even soldiers and when they saw how cheap and easy it was to buy guns non prohibited people and those who knew non prohibited people who would do it for them known as straw purchasers or buying up guns in Georgia for cheap real cheap bringing them up to New York selling them to their Associates on the street, you know, the gun they bought Georgia for a hundred and ten hundred twenty bucks that high point nine millimeter they were selling for  Box on the streets in New York Ian. These guns are being used in all sorts of crimes. So there was a massive domestic gun trafficking problem ATF and our state and local counterparts. We were all over it. Okay ATF invested time and money and you know, I did a ton of this stuff with the great Al Qaeda because Hinesville was a big area Hinesville, Georgia because it's almost Fort Stewart with you have now the home of the 3rd Infantry Division back then it was  24th ID but that's right. Same thing. You have soldiers coming from all of the states of the Union to military posts. And you know, when you're in somewhat rural Hinesville, Georgia, it's everything is available to you know, we saw it we addressed it. I mean we were we worked with a lot of the federal firearms licensees, you know, they we let them know we showed them how to recognize what was going on and they would actually give us a heads-up.  And you know, we made these cases and we essentially stomp that out. You know, that's one thing I said ATF essentially stomped out domestic contract. You just doesn't happen that often anymore. Now do gun still get from Source states to Target States they do but not in those trafficking numbers, right? Not not yet. You're not buying loads of 50 loads of a hundred that we were seeing going up there exactly and that get stomped on now the solution to that and let me you know,  I'm going to presume the way you guys find that out was not only cooperation with ffls and that kind of stuff but Gathering intelligence absolutely Gathering intelligence who these people are or where they're going and trying to predict where that goes the same thing can be done with criminal organizations low-level street gangs all the way up to organize, you know, National organized crime syndicates that same type of thing starts, boo.  On the ground street level intelligence work all the way up if you know who and what are the concerns and the problem with that is it takes a lot of time to do that and morning and man money, but the money is there. Yeah, the money's there look at let's take it in and go, you know, but maybe bility to do it. Is there between local law enforcement be city or state the county sheriff's police the way we always  as leave sheriff's deputies out in our conversations that can't forget them because they're essential same thing. The Department of Corrections the amount of intelligence that I've received on local street gangs from the Department of Corrections and things like the Georgia gang investigators association, all that kind of stuff. It can be done. It's been working. The thing is we just don't do it and we are speaking of law enforcement in general. We just don't keep our fingers on the pulse. We have a successful restaurant.  Put a bunch of people written then we move on to something else. Yeah, you can't do that. Yeah, you have to stay on that and you have to do it like a city like Savannah you have to do it in neighborhood at a time. But once you've gathered the Intel assign, somebody you're in charge of that neighborhood keep the Intel coming. Then you go get the Naps when you go get the next one. Eventually. You have the whole city and in the big cities you start with the gangs, right? Like I said, the trigger pullers who's pulling the triggers, that's who you start with and they jump right out.  Out to I mean, they're not they're not crafty. And like I said unlike the drug war it's doable. It's winnable drug wars not winnable. It's just not at this point. So this is something that is winnable. It's very controllable. But Beto it's not done by taking away rifles from law-abiding American citizens. You're not terrible idea. My man a terrible be like fixing the education problem where the  Will you get run by removing teachers? Wow, they're bad teachers. Let's get rid of them. Yeah, the kids will just learn. No, they won't only one. Yeah, so and you know, it's got to be done. If this could be done at all levels. Even you have to bring this all the way through the justice system. Yeah, so you can't be letting these people walk, you know, once once a police have done good work identified investigated arrested and brought these people and it's got to be carried all the way through nice and it does and and  When you hand out, you know, the the federal system the thing is is when you hand out a 20-year sentence for violent crime or or Firearms violations. It needs to be 20 years not five years, you know 15 years probate in that kind of stuff and it's cars incarceration the answer for everything. No. No, but it sure as hell for this for buyers and sellers. Yes. Yes, it absolutely is. If you've proved that you can't play nice in the sandbox. You can't be out in the sandbox. It says some  Which is you have to be separated and you know, we've got all the prisons in the world. We got plenty of Prisons thing is let's so you take you know, get some of these drug offenders out and let's put some violent criminals in unfortunately those two are in we'll talk about that and other shows those two worlds, whatever so closely related that the biggest thing I learned in the show. What have we learned today boots, you know that you disagree with me on things and it really kind of hurts my family. I think it makes for better listening when you disagree  3 but you made fun of Irish people and that's hurt which I'm just trying to uncover for our audience that deep down buried in that those multi layers that goes onions multi-layers of you is is a raging liberal down right at your core. I'm from Connecticut. Well, do you yeah, well covered up. I was I'm just trying to expose it to get this that only a smell out. Yeah. Now the other thing that we're going to do here on End of Watch is when we wrap up.  You're going to dedicate each one to fallen off. My the when I think we should do today is a sergeant Kelvin and sorry who was killed here in Savannah Georgia two months ago. He was killed at the hands of a prohibited person with a firearm. Yep. My during the commission of an armed robbery. He responded to an armed robbery caught and I work with sergeant and sorry long before he was Sergeant and sorry it was just  you know officer and sorry really good guy retired army veteran tired after 20 years and then spent 10 years with the Savannah Chatham Metropolitan Police Department, which is now the again city of Savannah's police department and he was shot and killed responding as a supervisor. He was one of the first guys there to respond to the robbery was involved in the shooting and where he ultimately was killed.  Just wanted to give a shout out to my former colleague and brother in arms Sergeant Kelvin and sorry. All right, I'm gonna give a shot out to to an officer who was killed many years ago border patrol agent Brian Terry who I'm Facebook friends with his brother can't and you know, so we get constant reminders of his senseless death. He was killed.  at the hands of a firearm that actually was walked by our own government to the cartels and he was killed defending this country on our border by one of these Firearms, you know, we've never really gotten to the bottom of that fur Agent Terry all of those documents need to be released and his family deserves closure and we need to see who was responsible for that and I think most importantly and I'm glad you're going  To the history, we can't forget any of them and I think in future podcasts will go back as long as we can because we don't ever these guys don't die as long as we keep their names fresh and don't forget what they sacrifice for our families and your family and so let's just keep their memories alive.\",\n",
              "   \"This is the acaba and show thank you for joining together. We will restore our America man. I'm excited. I'm excited for this first podcast and first show it's been a long time coming. But let's Dive Right In there are certain things in our country that we're touching That Should Be The Untouchables. You cannot touch the foundation of a country. The building will fall in a given example if the country was a high-rise building you could gladly go to the 30th floor and knock the walls out and redecorate the furniture and do with it. Really whatever you want. I don't really care what you do at the 30th floor if I don't live on the 30th floor, but what I do care about is when you get into the basement of the building and you start taking out Foundation because the whole building is going to fall what am I saying? When I'm saying this we cannot touch our children?  Our children are foundational in this country. When you start messing with our children, the building's going to fall the country will fall. We cannot touch the Constitution. It is foundational. So there's certain things that we should bipartisan just agree are The Untouchables, but unfortunately today we've got a bunch of people who seem to be very interested in having the building fall because they're touching certain things that shouldn't be touched. Now if you ask me family is untouchable.  The importance of family the importance of having a father in the house and having a father present with his children to me is Untouchable and I think statistics and history proves that when you remove the father from a home or you incentivize a family financially to have a father not be home you are going to touch the foundation of the building in the building is going to fall for many of you. You know, I fight child sex trafficking with a large group of people on our team and definitely  Rather give them the credit to myself.  Children are Untouchable we have come so far in our country today that we're now actually having groups in this country that are moving towards wanting to classify pedophilia as a sexual orientation again, I tell you if you want to do something with sex up at the 30th floor go at it. But when you start touching at children and start having adults make decisions sexually for our children or start manipulating our children or start grooming our children under the  Law or writing law that according to me is in contradiction with God's law that says take care of the Widow and the orphan and the child and feed the hungry and the poor you are absolutely touching the foundation of this country and we're going to see the country for that's why we say together. We will restore our America and when I say we got to restore our America, what am I talking about? I'm talking about restoring it morally first. Let's get a moral compass back in this  tree. Let's agree in this show that I'm not going to Hoodwink you and you're not ever going to feel like games are being played with you. We're going to get straight to the point. We're going to talk about things the others aren't talking about. We're not going to regurgitate news topics. If you've seen it on CNN or Fox, what's the purpose for me to talk to you about it? I want to talk to you about a life. I'm going to talk about your life because you matter I want to talk to you about your purpose. I want to talk to you about what happens when you wake up in the morning. Do you know what your purpose is?  You know where you're going. Do you understand how you fit into society. Do you know how many people watch you and learn from you good or bad? Do you know that how you feel by yourself at night is not how others see you. Do you know that the insecurities you carry is not how others see you necessarily. Do you know that certain things that you carry the baggage that you carry in life?  I believe God has forgiven you from if you believe in him, if you don't let's really meet on social media you DME and I'd love to introduce you to a better way and easier way to do life. But I will tell you this today. There are Watchman in this country and particularly those of faith. If you are someone a faith then you are by default a Watchman and we are not watching over our children. So let's dive into sex trafficking a little bit because a lot of you know that there's a lot of my social feed that focuses on sex trafficking and we're  Broadened the scope here in this show in this podcast to really go after how do we restore our America and this is not you know a gravy train about making America great again. No really. My focus here is morally and with intellectual honesty and with absolute truth. Let's restore this country to be the light Beacon that it was desired and destined to be for the nation's for all the nations. And yes particularly for our friend.  Israel sex trafficking is an epidemic in our country that is loose. Unfortunately. It is widely supported and it is being enabled with the justice system and and I will go after 100% after certain things that I think is absolutely a problem in sex trafficking today. But first, let's just get to the reality as you know, that it is real. It is happening in our communities. It is not just a runaway child. It is not just a kidnapping. This is not taken with Liam Neeson.  And the child that's a you know, foreign exchange student and all of a sudden. She's the wrong party the wrong time. We're talking about american-born children in our homes and our neighborhoods and they're being taken for granted and being abused sexually unfortunately on our watch how can this happen? How can it be the United States of America and not Cambodia or Thailand or the Dominican Republic or Haiti? It does happen there. Unfortunately, it happens in every single country in the world, but it happens in the United.  States and it happens in all 50 states of the United States and there's not a single zip code that is immune to this thing. Why because good men have done nothing. My wife was an amazing writer wrote the film eight days. For those of you haven't seen the film yet, please go watch the film 8 the number Ada ys8 days. It is about actual events of child sex trafficking in that film The Screen cuts to Black and Amber the victim you hear her thoughts and Amber says evil exists when good men do nothing and unfortunately in this country,  Of the supposedly good men are actually the Bad actors for how long that people think Epstein was a good man, but he's a bad actor and do not for one second think that it's the upper echelon. The one percent that's committing this crime. It's the Jeffrey Epstein's of the world and we have now caught our bad guy because I'll tell you America loves to find Billy the Kid, you know, when there's a crime committed you always hear the police saying we got to find the bad guy because there's an outcry from from the community the local community that's saying find the bad guy because we want to sleep at night.  So here's what happened with the me to movement the me to movement started off right the me to movement started off by women saying listen, we've got to speak up which is right. No abuse is acceptable at any level but then the me to movement Got Hijacked and unfortunately the bad guys also understand what when is enough pressure on them. They will self sacrifice one of their own so that the American population can sleep at night and think we caught the bad guy so Hollywood sacrificed Epstein and  Erica sang that song and Epstein's in prison and now everything is back to status quo in Hollywood because we caught our bad guy the same thing is happening with Epstein and O8 Epstein walked could have had him in a wait. He walked bum down to misdemeanor this time around.  Supposedly a suicide we won't get into that here, but he's no longer here the sex trafficking Community willingly sacrificed him and said you take Epstein catch. The bad guy in America is going back to sleep thinking we caught the bad guy because he's the only guy you're hearing about well, let me tell you what sex trafficking really looks like it is the janitor and the school principal the police chief and the senator the guy next door the Fortune 500 CEO.  The clerk the hospital worker the nurse the kindergarten teacher the guy that's teaching Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. It is everybody why because it is sexually immoral sin. It doesn't discriminate. This is not a black white hispanic Asian Native American issue. This is an issue where people make agreement with sexual immorality and ultimately that drug.  The most violent Most Dangerous Drug on Earth and it is vicious. It has no end the high will never stay the high you always got to go deeper down there Wormhole. And as one way and it's rock bottom and unfortunately Rock Bottom in that business is sex with a minor preferably for them pre-puberty. That is why the average age of children in our country that are being sexually sold for money, right and  For gifts and for favor is 12 years old. We lead the world with a the youngest average and unfortunately our country has done such a great job or a terrible job at protecting our children that we are the leading Nation on Earth commercializing sex with children sure this other nations where the occurrences are higher because some of those Nations condone it by their faith or their religion right like the Middle East under Sharia law certain things can happen that  Not happen under Christian, you know beliefs or under Catholic beliefs under Hinduism certain things can happen that polygamy, you know, people not living in in, you know, single person relationships, right? There's places in the world where child abuse or children being married off at 8. H8 is legal.  But they're not selling them for benefit in this country. We are selling our children because it is a commercial Enterprise. So how did we get here as American to a place where we have to say, let's restore our America together. You're a voice and I want you to be the voice to restore our America. How did we get here when we actually need people to be a voice to go restore America. We have forfeited the good things because we're afraid in this country good men are afraid to stand up.  We're afraid to be politically incorrect. Well here we are going to be politically incorrect because by default if I tell you who I am, they'll tell you a politically incorrect. Yes. I am a lover of Jesus Christ. I am a Christian. I'm a capitalist. I love the United States of America. I bleed red white blue. I am a legal immigrant. I'm a conservative but I will not politicize the issue of saving children. This is a bipartisan issue. There are things on this show that we're going to talk about where you  You are absolutely say well, that's partisan sure, but when it comes to saving our children and protecting our children, you hear me I have and will continue to fight as hard for the Muslim kit as the Christian kit the agnostic kit the Native American on the reservation or the agent illegal immigrant. It is irrelevant or the Hispanic or the South African illegal immigrant. It is irrelevant for me when it comes to children children have to be protected.  Because they are the least after all if I do believe in the book that I tell you, I believe the Bible then the Bible says better for you to have a millstone around your neck and throwing yourself in the ocean. You understand what that means right you go to the bottom and you don't come back up.  Rather do that than hurt a child.  But we have people in this country hurting children and we have a court system in this country that does not want to prosecute of course, not everybody but there is a silent violent epidemic among the district attorneys in this country that do not want to prosecute and this is almost an Untouchable issue particularly when you start talking about who is buying who is paying for sex with children.  Now that's an issue when it comes to. Hey, let's arrest a pimp. Let's arrest the bottom girl which by the way from between the pimp and the victim they are normally girls women who were victims themselves who are victims themselves were being forced to go recruit and basically manhandle these girls you see today that they looking for Jeffrey Epstein's accomplices these two women that were his recruiters. These pumps are cowards every single one of them. It's like a bully a bully is actually a very broken vessel that's crying.  For help, these guys are broken, but they're cowards. So they have women do their dirty work for them in between and these women have been coerced frauded manipulated right are in debt bondage, etc. Etc. Right. So we love arresting the pimp. We love arresting those Bottom Girls and previously we loved arresting the victim and calling them a prostitute. They're not prostitutes get that word out of your vocabulary a child that is sold for sex can never be a prostitute that child does not have the mental capacity.  capacity and we're going to bring some experts on to this show that's going to talk to you about how the brain works and I'll make sure to bring some experts on to the show that do not have my political beliefs, but that will come and be honest with you just about how the brain works what imprinting looks like when a child is prematurely, you know forced into a sexual situation or just exposed to sex as what they're trying to do today and our Public School System where they have CSE comprehensive not  Principal Robert comprehensive sexual education whether actually teaching 10 year old boys how to give consent to oral sex and to sex why in the world should attend your old know how to give consent unless you want him to give consent because you want to legalize pedophilia as a sexual orientation in you want that child to be an accomplice right for it to be consensual. It's sick. It's sick. Let me tell you it's twisted.  It we have folks in this country that have made an agreement with the Enemy with evil and they want the building to fall. That's why they are attacking the foundation of this country and I'm saying no more you're a voice and you're going to stand up. We're going to protect the foundation. We're going to give people equal rights everybody under the Constitution black white red Hispanic Conservative Christian LBGTQ. It doesn't matter you have your rights under the Constitution, but you cannot Jack  Constitution because the building will come down and then everybody dies  Unless that's what they want. Unless the motive is no more America as it used to be and that is not going to happen not on our watch because I believe we've been given a Great Commission. Yes by God to be a nation of all Nations to be a lighthouse or the other nations. Don't hit the rocks that their ship can sail freely and Nation to be the only real true friend of Israel. Thank you President Trump for moving and all.  Was involved in wasn't just one man. Moving that Embassy to Jerusalem to make a bold statement to say listen, we are actually with you because I do believe a friend of Israel as a nation. It's going to stand and that is under attack in this country. We've got college campuses in this country that have outlawed pro-israel speech.  Unacceptable that's anti-semitic that by default. My friend is racism to not for one second think that racism is a black-white thing.  It's so funny, you know, you get these people who will say, you know, people are Nazis. They throw the word Nazi out and they throw white supremacy up so they call Hitler and Nazi and they call Hitler a racist. Well, if Hitler was a racist which he was why because he profiled a single race and his objective was to exterminate a whole race. Do you know that he actually collected artifacts? He collected art and painting and writings on the Jewish nation, and he was going to build a  Museum to showcase the race that he exterminated from the planet that by default is racism. Then why today if Israel is under attack, is it not racism or any race for that matter that gets profiled. I was after all a raised in a country that once was the most racially contentious Nation on the face of the Earth. Yes, South Africa, and as God would have it. I was raised in the heightened era of apartheid born in 76.  Six graduate high school and 94 Nelson Mandela president and 95. So I was at the precipice. I Saw The Perfect Storm, but then again, I was raised by a mother that didn't see color so actually by default, although I was a Caucasian young white male man in South Africa. It was the white folks that accused us of being pro black.  You see because no matter who you stand for. There's always going to be a group that's going to be against you that think differently it is the notion that you can please everybody that is making America fall at the moment. You cannot please everybody you've got to have a spine and a backbone and those guys that came over on the Mayflower wrote a declaration of independence wrote a constitution late. The laws in the foundation with spine. They were not trying to please everybody clearly they were not  Using to those who they flee from on the Nations where they came from or or the country they created for all of us as immigrants. I'm an immigrant to come to and say yet. There's a better place. There's a place that's more free. There's a place where I can dream. So why is that under attack today? It is under attack because certain people want to control other people just like they want to control children because of you lower the age consent for sex from 1618 16 to 10.  N or 212 you take away a child's choice is that not into in contradiction with the whole movement today of everybody has choice, you know, I call it the me movement really of you need to conform law and you need to confirm your lifestyle according to how I feel.  Here and it's about me it's about I identify or how I want my food or how I want my state to be in everybody has to start, you know, identifying that way or start conforming to me and if I change my mind next week, then everybody needs to change life doesn't work that way. Let me give you a quick little example. It's football season, right? So let's say Aaron Rodgers the Packers this coming Sunday would say not but let's say this coming Sunday. The Packers are playing the  Two amazing quarterbacks, you got Rogers and Brady and we go prior to the game and we erase the sidelines.  The team runs out on the field both teams, and there are no side lines.  What do you think would happen?  Absolute Anarchy because Brady would say well this in this left hash mark is out of bounds. Aaron Rodgers would say what I want to score a touchdown, you know on the 5-yard line and out of balance has 4 rows into the stands. You cannot even play a football game without rules and Regulation and construct. How in the world. Are you going to run a country? If you destroy all of its foundation and its rules and it's construct you cannot  The notion that we can operate without a police force the notion that we should get rid of certain police departments or law enforcement departments is insanity. There's no argument. We don't even need to argue about this. Let's be intellectually honest. Let's get back to a place that's healthy where we can actually agree to disagree where we can actually have conversation in walk away from a conversation like two great price Fighters a heavy weight against the  In about a month and a half you got Ruiz right fighting and defending his title again against Anthony. Joshua two guys are going to Duke it out. They going to knock the living snot out of each other and I'm telling you they're buying each other a beer right after because that's what athletes do there's no Vengeance. There's no hate. There's no bitterness. We disagree in this ring right now and we can go to blows But ultimately certain things are bigger than us that flag that some people choose to burn in this country. It's bigger than  An you it's bigger than a political party.  And ultimately the Constitution is bigger than you and bigger than your party and our children is bigger than you and I and it's bigger than the Republican party or the Democratic party or the independence. It is bigger than any political agenda. It is after all our future there is no United States, whichever kind you want without our children. There is no future growth in technology without our children. It's very interesting when you start looking at how many people  People today that were never supposed to live for whatever reason became Pioneers became groundbreakers became people that defied the odds that the child born at 22 weeks that should not have brain function that goes on and becomes a math professor.  right or a scientist or a brilliant athlete  You do not have a handle on life. You can never control it as little as you can control. The weather. God is in charge. He's on the throne and he has a purpose for your life and ultimately my prayer for you and my hope for you is that you discover that purpose because they are my friend. You're going to find Joy there. You're going to find happiness there. You're going to find and find out that it's not about you. It's actually about other people. It's actually about what you do.  Four and two and with other people it's actually about teamwork. It's actually about transferring wisdom and wealth and knowledge. It's actually about transferring opportunity. It's actually about us building a country today that stronger than yesterday so that I kids from Tomorrow start further ahead. But then we've got people in this country that when a breakout children down,  You've got certain countries in the world right now that's growing at a negative growth rate by purpose. China doesn't want to grow and people say there's too many people in the world get in your car and take a drive when last did you drive across the Midwest when last did you drive east to west coast in Texas? Have you seen the Open Spaces? Have you seen how big the world is? Can I take you to Africa and show you what it looks like when you can travel for five days and not see anybody.  Do you understand how big this planet actually is?  Do you understand that this planet is so beautifully and wonderfully made it actually restores itself if we take good care of it.  So for this episode I'm going to make you remember that it's about our children and they are Untouchable. They are foundational all of them. The underprivileged kid today that lives in the projects whose parents struggle to put food on the table is as important as a kid that has already been tapped by Harvard or Yale the kit that's already been tapped by being in Juilliard. They're no different. They are no different. They're equally important each to their own a skill set.  Divinely created by God. Yes, maybe in the future different job titles, maybe one becomes president of the United States and the other one is a janitor at a high school will let me tell you that janitor at that high school. He's eyes and ears or she is eyes and ears for kids. So you can interact and uplift people that grade school teacher is as important as the college professor. No one person more important than another a society working together respecting one another first when you meet a human being asking yourself, let me  find their value. Let me find their purpose. Let me find a way to encourage them. Let me find a way to uplift them versus can I compete or can I break them down to seemingly lift me higher. Let me tell you something. If you're one of those people that like to break others down to make yourself feel better.  When you do that, you're actually digging a hole and you're sinking you have as little impact on them as your bitterness in your heart towards someone else. They don't even know that you're better you're poisoning yourself.  So I'm going to ask you today. Are you going to be part of the people that's going to help me restore our America restore value restore family restore purpose restored real love not feeling by the way love is not a feeling. We're going to have a whole show about love becoming a feeling in this country. Love is not a feeling you ask any married couple. It's definitely not a feeling these days when my wife does she does not like me nor does she have to like me?  Has to love me. That's what God says because love is a choice. See it's the moment when I do not look lovable when I am not likeable, which is too often, right? It's in that moment when she chooses to love me that it is sacrificial Rite not about her but about me and that's when bonds are being strengthened. That's real love. So don't for one second thing because someone agrees with you they love you. That's not love. That's a feeling and don't for one.  Second thing when someone does not agree with you that they do not love you. You're listening to the wrong voice. I want you to learn what the right choice is to listen to so let's agree in this show. We're going to be honest. We got to call pedophiles pedophiles.  We're not going to tiptoe around people that are sick demented Twisted that wants sex and abuse with little children. I'm not going to pull punches in the show. I'm going to tell you about Hollywood. I'm going to tell you about the Cesspool of pedophilia in Washington DC. I'm going to name names.  And we're going to take care of business and we're going to restore America we're going to do it with love but we are for once and for all in this nation again going to draw a line in the sand and say there's good and there's evil.  And I'm not talking about people that is a spiritual battle that people make agreement with every person has good and bad in them. It depends which one of those you feed is what will manifest and if you've made a decision that you want to feed the evil part then evil is going to manifest through your life. Am I saying the person is evil now the spirit in which they operate and with which they made an agreement may be an evil spirit.  May want to harm people. There's good in everybody. Have you met a mass murderer?  Have you met somebody that tells you they've stabbed somebody 36 times because I have and I've watched that individual turn a life around and I've watched that individual in prison serve their time and give their heart to God and start a prison ministry and start building others up and repent and repent and really understand what had happened a life can change but it takes a massive event to change a life.  But I'll tell you what's really difficult.  And I'll get real serious with you restoring a child. There was sexually Savaged over and over.  Is almost impossible?  By main strength it is in fact impossible.  There is no 12-step program like alcohol anonymous that's going to help that child.  Because no two are alike each unique individual at some point suffered abuse made an agreement with what love is or is not made an agreement of self-worth the self-loathing the justification the questions the hurt the physical mental emotional spiritual abuse The Emptiness. Do you know how hard it is to rehabilitate that child to restore that child? That's why I say let's restore our  Erica so we do not have to restore children that are broken like that because if you are part of the problem  Today I'm telling you go get help and get it quickly because we're coming.  And for the bad guy if you're the perpetrator and you're harming children, you're going to go you got to go to a dark cold place for a long time because it's going to take that child a long time to be restored.  We're going to dive deep in this show into what is sex trafficking. What does it look like? This was the first episode to let you know what the show is going to be about. Yes. It's going to be intense. I'm actually dialing it back. We're going to crank it up for you next week once a week. You're going to get the show. I'm asking you to subscribe. I'm asking you to let everybody know. This is a show where we can agree to disagree. We're going to be honest. We're going to be intellectually honest. We're going to be morally honest.  and hopefully I believe with your voice and my voice together we're going to be able to restore our American it is after all our America it doesn't belong to one group or one political party how good would it be to look at both sides of the aisle again in Congress and see that there are certain things maybe let's define them together that are Untouchable that are deemed to be foundational in this country that cannot be touched or the building will fall and  We'll never let the bad guys make this building fall. This country is the greatest nation on Earth. It is a gift to be an American citizen. If you have forgotten it take a trip to Africa go dig a well.  Go carry water for 4 miles and call me when you touch back down in Atlanta, Georgia, New York and you kiss the ground and you realize that we in fact.\"]]}"

            "Welcome back to GRE vocab.  Before we continue. We just want to give a quick shout out to the people who make this podcast possible. Anchor anchor is everything you need to make a podcast in one place. They distribute your podcast for you. They have tools that allow you to record and edit everything right from your phone or computer. It's free the even allow you to put ads in your your podcast. It's pretty awesome. Go check it out download the free anchor app or go to Anchored off dot f m-- to get started. Okay, let's get back to the show.  Today's words are fatuous, silly and pointless apocryphal.  Of doubtful authenticity, although widely circulated as being true usually in regards to a story or statement a credit e having an acrid smell accurate is having an irritant Lee Strong and unpleasant taste or smell angry bitter.  Trench in see in size of - keenness and forcefulness of thought or expression or intellect euphony the quality of being pleasing to the ear, especially through a harmonious combination of words.  Trump trump Trump trump no matter what you think of him. You got to admit. He's very entertaining especially when it comes to his tweets.  A lot of his tweets are completely fascists. Remember the the whole kafei tweet where he tweeted a word that said Kofi. I like 2:00 in the morning unbelievable. Basically all of his tweets are trenchant. He's very bold once everyone to listen every once in a while though. He'll have a rather euphonious comment. I assume those pleasing tweets are in by his professional speech writers right now is impeachment trial is  Underway, some say is conversation with Ukrainian president clearly frames it but others say it that is apocryphal. We'll just have to see what happens.  That's all for GRE vocab. We wish you guys the best of luck if you're taking the test this week.  Also, if you wouldn't mind leaving us a review the be much appreciated. Thanks so much. See you next time.\n"
