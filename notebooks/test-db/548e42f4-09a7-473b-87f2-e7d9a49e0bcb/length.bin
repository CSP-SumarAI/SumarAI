ystem. Like this one's better than this one, you know, and so we're going to rank them from you know, an each week. Basically we're going to talk a little bit maybe 5-10 minutes will spend on each one talking about dis is what we think about it this what we like about this is what we don't like about it and then we're going to put it on the ranking system. So, you know, the first one will be number one, but you know won't last long maybe so but yeah, this is this is going to be  You have been paying attention to our Naughty Dogs ranked at all. It's going to be something similar to that but we are going to try to add a little bit of point value to it where we are going to have. Okay the visuals how much how much are we willing to give that to you know is an eight seven six five four, three two one, you know things like that. So take away from the game experience. It's exactly like that. Exactly exactly. So there's going to be a little bit of rankings and it'll just be fun like Nate said just to kind of play some different ones. We've been on apex Legends for a long time that will not a long time cheese.  And Nick get over yourself. But yeah, it will be interesting just to try new ones. Honestly, I I am kind of excited to try out Pub G like I have never ever been a pub G fan like but I've also never played it. So it'll be interesting to play and it's on PlayStation now, so I actually plan on getting PlayStation now, even if it's just for one month so I can try out. Gee it'll be my first time ever playing it like was I just being full of myself or was I completely right?  I don't know which one it will be but it'll be fun to find out. So if you guys want to play along with us, you know, go ahead and you know, we'll reveal what game we're going to be playing that week. Give us your impressions on everything like that. So having said that yes, the first one is going to be Pub G. It's one, you know, I haven't personally have you played it mate. No, I haven't but I am excited to play to see if they fixed anything or just left a broken mess. Yeah. I'm interested just too.  And I mean, the reason we're choosing it is kind of it was the first one which yes, there's going to be tons of. Oh, no Minecraft was the first one or this game was the but this is the first one that kind of popularized Battle Royale. And so that's why I'm kind of excited like to see where it kind of started even though. Yes, I think even H1Z1 was before it. You know, I get that but what I'm saying is undeniably what made it really really popular was Pub gee that was the one where it was breaking.  Records of most congruent players. So this is kind of like where the Battle Royale craze began even though. It might not have been the instigator or the very first one. It was definitely the one that people started paying attention to battle royal as a general or in general. So I'm excited and now I'm even more excited because neither one of us have ever played it so that's really exciting. So if you'd like to join us, it is one of the games for the PlayStation Now,  So if you're on Playstation, go ahead and try it out. There is a 7-Day free trial if you want to do PlayStation. Now if you don't want to play for PlayStation, or if you don't want to pay for PlayStation now, make sure you go to your subscriptions and make it so that it doesn't Auto renew because that's definitely if you don't want to pay for it. I completely get that but seven days, so that's all we need until our next episode. So go ahead and go play it figure out what it is and we're going to do some rankings on it. I can't wait. It's going to be fun.  Fantastic. Yeah can be fantastic. Alright, so that was this episode of new once again, you know, thank you for showing up. Also.
