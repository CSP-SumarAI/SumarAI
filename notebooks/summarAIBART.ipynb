We wanted to share something with you that we've been working on enjoy. Hello, I'm Nick and I'm Nate. We are threatened X3 Productions. Tell me if this sounds familiar. I used to listen to radio all the time either driving or on in the background at home. But after a while, I started listening less and less the DJ's just didn't talk about things that I was interested in mainly gossip like who's getting married who cheated on.  Who and oh, is that a baby bump but as a super nerve there was just no topics. I liked hearing about movies were mainly good or bad. No in-depth talks and video games were the worst if they were brought up at all. It was almost guaranteed to be negative. I didn't really mind the music brakes but the ad seemed to go on forever. So I switched to podcasts. I got the topics that I cared about and adds didn't overstay their welcome. So what if we could have the best of both worlds, that's where we come in.  Introducing the national nerd Net radio direct or nerd radio for short topics, you love from podcast, but music curated by the community and best of all, no ads only short sponsor reads.

You can also check out our production company, which is thread X3 Productions at gmail.com or at  Tx3 Productions on Twitter when CH you can always figure out updates for that new radio that we're talking about that nerd radio. So let's jump into things. We're going to actually go straight to our topic of the week. Alright guys. So topic of the week. I always try to figure out you know,  Is everybody actually talking about last week people seem to be talking about there's not enough to do and this week There's been like a couple of different videos of is Apex dying and there is a couple of these a couple of weeks ago a couple of these a couple weeks ago and I kind of just didn't pay attention to them because it just seems like a fad, you know what I mean? It just seems like oh, well, you know this game is x amount old. So that means it has to be dying and it  just seemed like noise and it also just seemed like personal opinions, but then they started coming out with like upper-echelon came out with one and inside gaming came out with one and they specifically went into like the numbers of it the numbers at the beginning the numbers now and you know and things like that. So kind of wanted to talk about that try to hit like all the Avenues not just like, oh, we hate it and everything and that's definitely a disclaimer we have to talk about  Because any time we start talking in a sort of negative way. We can sometimes be categorized as complaining and that's one thing. I just want to make sure you guys know that you know, hey, we love the game. We still love the game. We still like playing it and this is just some critical things that we've seen being said about it not just from us but from the overall community and so that's why we're going to try to cover kind of all sides of it today and really figure out you know, what's  Going on would you agree absolutely absolutely would agree.  So so other than the other than the upper echelon, and like Insider Gaming's the main things that they were pointing out as like there's a big spike of streamers and people watching it on Twitch and nowadays. It's not so much. Yeah, it's those parts of the videos are definitely part of the conversation because of course the they're breaking down the actual numbers of everything the statistics and things like that giving you the facts.  All information on the situation maybe not necessarily a lot of content behind it in terms of what the other Gamers think but if we're there talking specifically math and factors and things like that. So that's why it's an important thing to talk about because you know, of course everyone has their opinion on the game, but this is statistics here, you know, so it's they're just pointing out that hey it's not doing as well as it probably should do to how good the game is.  Yeah. Yeah, and I do feel like it's also such a weird discrepancy that it did kind of blow up and it did get just so much recognition. I mean 50 million and a quarter of the time that it took for tonight to get 50 million. And so then it just kind of dropped off to such a degree that it's actually kind of surprising, you know, when you look at the numbers now, I wonder and maybe this is just me apologizing for a  But I wonder if maybe maybe part of the reason is that it's not as fun to watch versus it's much funner to play. So maybe the reasons the twitch numbers are as high is because it's also just less or it's more fun to play but that does kind of seem like me like apologizing for it. And I mean one thing I pair pointed out like last week and in particular was the fact that like the main people who play this like 8:00.  Eight hours a day day after day after day after day six days a week. Those are people who are complaining about it and saying, you know going out to all their followers. So of course when they say that they're not going to play the game as much then obviously you're going to have their followers. They're going to like, oh, yeah, maybe I shouldn't play either so there is kind of that factor.  So leading into that one of the things that we're going to bring up is a topic and a response that was brought up by myth now myth tweeted that it was a couple different tweets. So the first one they read into each other. He says my thoughts about Apex content topic pushing out content for the sake of pushing out content is unhealthy and I completely agree with them on that front. I assume talking about the streamers and every all the other content creators. He then says but pacing out your content over an  Amount of time can create some very dangerous expectations that if not met can burn budget can burn Bridges very fast with your community. I think Apex doesn't need to do huge content updates. Like they might think they do but even just a few small things once every three to four weeks to keep players engaged wouldn't hurt content doesn't need to be a new item or hero. Yeah. And I mean, this is completely agreeable. I mean and I feel like he is you could definitely hear and in the  way he decided to present it that you know, hey, you know, I do like the shit. I do like the game. It's not that like, I hate it or anything and Ike I think as far as like him talking about like pushing out content for the sake of pushing out content, you know, it did seem like maybe in some ways like Fortnight blackout and other things they would just like here's a new skin. Here's a new this and they they do it. So frequently, I do feel like maybe it gave people an unhealthy.  Um, look at how fast content comes out. Now, you couple you couple this with the report that just came out about how people working on on Fortnight are working, you know anywhere from like sixty to a hundred hour weeks to get that content that was coming out constantly, you know Fortnight was like the king and that's what everybody's going to compare this to so when Fortnight at the same time that we  that we are right now Fortnight had already had patches like every week or every other week and they've been starting on season 2 not season 1 in the same amount of time that we're talking about with Apex, you know, but how much of that was at the expense of well, well, we need to work a hundred hours a week, you know, so I feel like he is he is myth at least, you know, he's hitting a pretty good balance where he's not saying that he wants  You know a new character every week. I mean even OverWatch going to do that and like blizzard is freaking huge. You know, it's probably I'd say comparable to Epic size or maybe even bigger. I mean, this is Blizzard and you know blizzard is just huge and they only put out a character like once a year or something like that. What's a Rosy or something like that? Yeah. So I mean like it makes sense and I do have to agree with them and I don't think personally it has anything to do with items.  Our Heroes I do feel like it just would be nice that something new is happening all the time, you know, and we've said it once I'll say it a thousand more times limited time modes, you know, like here's a mode here's a new thing. Here's the thing of the week that we can all talk about we can gather around the water cooler and talk about our experiences do we like it do we hate it? You know because even in that sense, even if limited time mode comes out and nobody likes it. It's still getting them too.  To try it out. It's still getting them to log on. Obviously. You can't have too many l TMS and that are bad in a row because then you know, that's just real bad marketing. But what I'm trying to say is that just getting stuff out on a regular basis or you know, bi-weekly basis is a good thing, you know, and it's and it's just the fact that when you have internet heads and they're able to Crunch the numbers and they look at what Fortnight done and what Apex is done.  You know like your your average people like I'd say me and you you know, your average person is going to look at that and be like well, yeah, but that's Fortnight. This is Apex. They're trying to create something different here and we're able to see that but then your every man your casuals like the people who maybe you know, don't main one game they play Everything which is good. Obviously, that's not a bad thing. But I'm saying that they don't really care too much about the success or failure of Apex. But yet that's all they talk about is the success.  Failure of Apex because it gets them clicks. It gets them views it gets them, you know, notoriety or whatever but that that can be detrimental to the overall, you know message. Yeah, and I think were and I actually really enjoy this we're having a constant conversation in the community revolving Apec evolving around revolving around Apex in terms of different things that are either critiques or just people saying hey, like look at this. Let's have a conversation about  What each individual person thinks is going on. So like there's a lot of different conversations that are going to go on this topic myth really being the start. I think very poignant and to into a tea as far as his side of what's going on with the game. There are some other things that popped up on on the subreddit on the Apex Legend subreddit that one of them in particular says is titled unpopular opinion. The game isn't dying. You've probably played too much. So this which was sort of my  Stan's last week when I was all like stop playing this in the game. So damn right which I think this point of view ties into myths very well. We can cover a good bit of this but he in a very much appreciate you Cohen underscored Dev on Reddit. He puts a tldr at the beginning that says how many hours we used to pour into shooter games like Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike without any goals to strive for other than to have fun when  those gays when those games became temporarily boring you moved on and came back later to enjoy it just as much if you're feeling bored with this game do that like go and play something else or just and come back or just enjoy the game for what it is which again I think is very poignant. And he actually that's that's a brilliant thought that I hadn't thought about with games like Titan and this this completely like contradicts what I said last week, but I didn't think about it in this light we  Games like Team Fortress 2 in Counter-Strike people play those games for years, like possibly ten years. There's don't plan on they're still playing it and there's nothing really to strive for other than to just have fun in the game other than to get good Sun exactly other than to get good and last week when I talked about this I was talking about how I wish that there was something like a carrot on the end of the stick for me, like just something visual that I can see right, right. You know, it just is Apex that kind of game. Is it that kind of game that you can play?  Over and over again just have fun. And this I actually think is a conversation about Battle Royale games to most people this is the new Evolution of games like Counter-Strike and Team Fortress 2 for me Point good point the player that I am. This is why I've said before that this is a reason why I really would like singles or you know singles are Duo's. So those are Duo's in Apex is because like prime example, I've played it within the past 12 hours. I just I was just in the mood to play shooter.  So I jumped on Titanfall 2 because it's a self-contained I can play a match to match basis. And I'm only relying on my skill not relying on anybody else's I was having an absolute blast. I started playing that game when it came out. You know, I played it a lot more heavily six months to a year later and I'm still regularly playing it just because I have a lot of fun with it now for battle royales in general for me personally. I don't get that same enjoyment, you know when I would play Fortnight whenever it was popular for a while.  While it's just wasn't my kind of game. I I'm not the type of person who's going to play Battle royales consistently. I'm looking for a different experience. So that definitely it's it brings up an interesting topic of is Apex that kind of game. Is it going to be a replacement of Team Fortress 2 or Counter-Strike innocence? We all we all know that nothing is going to replace those games. Those games are Classics, but you know now Battle Royale is the new basically generation of games like this that have are supposed to have a long  Gravity to them so but I mean the main part of is is it's not dying. You've played too much. I think that speaks volumes to the state that we're in right now with all these different content creators as they played Non-Stop and like Nick was saying they've probably played so much they've gotten everything or got everything they want and now they're waiting for something else and saying that that times boring is that necessarily true. I think that's subjective. I honestly think it's subjective, you know, there are people who are not very high level in the game that are still enjoying it.  Still Loving the game. So this whole thing is so multifaceted that it's it's it's a very interesting conversation of breakdown. Yeah, and I mean, I'm definitely I think I am kind of on I'm still I still agree with what I said last week as far as like and I think the best way to put it is if you're feeling bored, you know, go play a different game or enjoy what this or was this a or just enjoy the game for what it is and I do feel like that's one thing.  You know like when everybody even when you Nate, I love you. I love you. Don't worry. I'm not mad at you. Even when you bring up like solos and Duo's or whatever. That's one thing that I'm like that's not what it's for, but I am totally willing to just be like, you know, what? Yes. Okay, you can have solos and Duos but that is one thing that like until we do get that like just have fun with the game for what it is, you know, and so that is kind of a really good point in the sense that there are so many.  Any people who maybe just want this game to be something else or even should just be like a normal Battle Royale but it's like but that's why we fell in love with it in the first place. We didn't fall in love with this just because you know, we got to drop off of a drop ship, you know, go down to the Earth pick up a bunch of guns and then start shooting each other. We got we fell in love with this for all the subtleties for the characters for you know, the movement and everything.  That's why we fall fell in love with this game. So and I mean I can fully admit to not enjoying this game for what it was because you know, like I was putting way too much focus on like I have to be the best that I ever was and so if I'm not, you know pulling in the winds, then I'm just not going to have fun with the game and that was a really negative place to be in and so like I've kind of after that really bad week though. I was talking about a couple weeks ago.  I've been having more fun with the game in general, you know, and it was just pretty much to the point where like, you know, I play other games like World War Z just came out really really good game. If you like Left 4 Dead back and like back in the day. Try it out because it's really good. They just put out a tweet or whatever. They just sold like, you know, two million within the first two days or something. It's like well good, you know, and it's like I can go and I can I can go enjoy that and then I can come back to Apex and just have fun with it. Not not.  About the grind not worried about you know, well how what's my kill to death ratio? You know, I don't have to worry about that because I can just have fun with it and the same thing we got days gone coming out. Well by the time this is uploaded today that's coming out today. I got in game. I got so many things to worry about that. Just having fun with Apex sounds like a really good Prospect and I do want to Circle back to something you were bringing up. I think the perfect thing that they can do.  To help the longevity of the game at least in this current state that it's in is limited time modes 100% You know, you think about blackout blackout was popular from the beginning but you had a lot of people that are in the same state of it was kind of like, okay, we've been playing this for months now like what? Okay, like what and then they really started releasing limited time modes like snipers only rockets on with snipers and Rockets things like that. Yeah, and they added a new map, you know Alcatraz, so they are doing things that are helping this game prosper and keep bringing people pack.  Keep bringing people back now. I'll ask you a question. Do you feel like respond and Apex is doing the same thing with this game or do you think that they're just letting the game speak for itself saying hey, if you are wanting to play this game, you'll play the game because it's that good. Yeah. I don't know that's where that's where the difficult question comes because if that's what they want to do. Then that's their prerogative. However, the numbers don't lie and the numbers are telling us that  It's it's below a lot of get like if you go on to Twitch and you look at the viewership or whatever. It's like almost not even top 10. I want to say what's it's probably like number nine or something like that. And so funnily enough like League of Legends is now back up at the top even over Fortnight. So I thought that was like, oh, well, you know good for them. They were number one for a really long time. So it is hot games the top categories right now. I want which is fortnight grand theft in order Fortnight grandmother.  Theft Auto V League of Legends just chatting, which is cool. I did note which had that Pub G World of Warcraft the new expansion magic Counter-Strike Mortal Kombat 11 and days gone.  With the top three having a hundred seventy nine with Fortnight a hundred and thirteen thousand those were such as where's Apex then it's not on it's not on these first six or eight on popular categories. So yeah, I think the the list I was going off of was actually older. So now X is not on the frittata and the slider. Yeah, it's not even on the front page, you know, so like going back to the point then is the numbers don't lie. You want respawn to pave their own path.  But at the same time I won't respawn this is gonna sound really bad, but it's like but I won't respond to succeed and right now they're not succeeding as much as I would hate to admit it. They're not because when they're not even on the front page anymore that is a problem because being viewed is the best thing that they can do and I do feel like even though  even though I don't agree with with Ninja doctor disrespect, you know Drifter, even though I don't necessarily agree with them in the sense that there's just not enough to do when I played eight hours a day. And so that means that it's trash or I don't know I'm being way fishy sis here. But even even though I don't agree with that, however, those are kind of the people you need to keep excited because those are the people who talk about the game when the game starts.  Talked about less people start talking about other things. That's just how Humanity works.  Now something to be fair just to bring into the twitch conversation Fortnight did drop their Avengers in game mode today. So that probably has a lot to do with where with why that's so high apart from just what would you say? What would you say that the Avengers game mode is what's it called? Just had it and game.  Now limited time Mojo. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was being Skelly being facetious. I gotcha. I gotcha for the further clarification. Apex Legends right now on Twitch has 28 thousand viewers.  Like compared to and obviously that is right at the second of this recording. So maybe later tonight. It's going to jump back up to the triple digits. So please don't tweet us like well actually, yeah, so please don't do that. But at the time, you know, 11:36 am here in you know, Idaho as of the time of the recording that's what the numbers are at. That's not good and Pub G is anything 6000? Oh God.  It's getting beat by Pub by pube G. Yeah. Oh, that's so it's one of those again. We want we want to further just clarify. We are not this is not a complaint or anything. We are talking about factual numbers here. Like Nick said, please don't tweet it. It's be like, oh, well, actually, please don't do that. We're talking about what the numbers are right now in the numbers don't lie. It's not a saying Hey, Oh Pub Jews is better than Apex because it's showing more at that's not it in the slightest. I feel like  don't have to clarify this but I but I also feel like we also need to clarify that which is there's always going to be one person out there. Right? Right. So it's you know, and you have other parts of this argument of this whole conversation where people are like there was another post it said can we address the issues that really matter now for clarification? I'm not going to read all of these because some of these Deuce correct me if I'm wrong from what you read a lot of the sound Nick nitpicky. Do you like very nitpicky? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I can agree with that. Yeah.  There are some things that are interesting that you brought up like one of he has like a list of bugs and glitches to change new features and quality of life stuff that he would that this person would want to see in the game but one of them and terms of bugs, what was it? You said something about that. They just fell fix broken Pathfinder hitbox dead zones. So we don't know the clarification on that because they just fix something with Pathfinders hitbox. So is it broken? Yeah. Yeah and that  Kind of I can see what you mean by nitpicky because it's like I hate I really do I genuinely hate when somebody calls something broken because broken to me means that when I during one of the very first competitions ninja got stuck in midair and one of his friends had to pull off like a really cool move to you know, revive him or whatever that is broken that is broke.  But when a hitbox is slightly off or a hitbox isnt what you want it to be or maybe the fire rate of the you know, the are 301 is not good enough for you. That doesn't make it broken. I hate that that phrase in particular is so overused. You know, it's just it's so frustrating. Can we try to stop saying something's broken. It's not broken and needs to be fixed. Sure.  Or it can be altered. Let's let's put it that way because fix would imply that it's broken but it could it be altered could it mean made better? Of course, you know that's part of the game and part of the reason why we're talking about, you know, the state of the game is because like, of course it can always evolve.  Right and you know he I'm reading through this through this whole thread and there were a lot of things on here that I thought were interesting and I'll bring some of them up but some of them are just like very like literally very nitpicky like one. Wait. Wait, wait. Wait, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.  On Reddit on Reddit. Yeah on what is already know on one of their quality of life changes. They said something like this one. I agree with color-coded teammate traps like for caustic.  Okay, I can understand that. There was no like that was like see it through a wall or something. Maybe there is another one that said limit the amount of times a down teammate can ping. I was like no, I don't agree with that at all. Well, sometimes I can be annoying when someone's like yeah, so I can I can understand that, you know to a certain extent plus it's like they're almost more.  Useful when they're down. Yeah.  There was one in new feature section that he added that crate drops after level 100.  That could be something good. What do you mean crate?  I imagine I imagine fixing either getting crate drop. I mean, I don't know. This is from Reddit. I'm just really I'm just reading what's on here. Maybe he means Apex packs because I know they get super scarce. Once you're once you're in the app, that's what I kind of assumed. Maybe that's what it means. Okay, but there's things also like rework mirages ultimate and passive. I mean, I could see reworking his all you were already. Yeah. We were already kind of talking about that personally. Yeah. So I mean there's there's something there custom products and I thought  That big yes. Yeah. See see now the ones I could agree with is like the custom servers would be awesome. I mean we have a we have a community on Discord. It'd be awesome just a jump in with you guys and have some fun, you know, another one leaderboards. I don't personally care because I'm going to be at the bottom. Anyways, you know, but it like there's certain things that come with the leaderboard. It's not just a my number one in the world. It's also how many wins Total do I have how many kills  Total do I have and that's something that like I could see what they were trying to do as far as like, oh, here's all your wins with Gibraltar. Here's all your wins with Bangalore, but I want to know how many wins Total I have. I don't want to own one. I don't want to know how many with that character because me personally and I think there's probably a lot of you out there. But me personally I kind of switch it around part of that is because of the battle pass and how it gives you bonuses for playing as different characters, but then part of that also is  Is it depends on like who is on my team what they are? I never choose a character because I want to pay is that character? I choose a character based on the team Dynamic I didn't and I try to I try to mix it up to because I don't want to get too comfortable because then it's like, you know, you always want to stay on your feet or whatever, which I really saw it because I played a lot of Lifeline recently because no one's getting lifeline and I really enjoy playing his lifeline and that's I was Pathfinder race main for the  Longest time and now now lifelines in there because I just enjoy the gameplay that I have with her. Right? And so yeah, so then back to my point is like, you know, that's the game. They wanted to create they wanted to create a game where you're maybe switching around you can have fun with any Legend. It doesn't have to be one. However, a global win a global kill count is something I feel like anybody and everybody wants, you know, they want to know because even  even if we're just having fun with the game for what it is, we still want to know how we're progressing. You know what I mean? And yeah sure how many kills were getting with wraith is fine. But then if we switch over to another character it D incentivizes us to switch to that character when we see the kills are a fraction of what we have with The Wraith.  Right, I agree. I've always enjoyed and Shooters being able to look at my full combat record and see what my full stats are instead of like individual as which I see why they're doing that at the same time like universalize it like make it a little bit easier. Yeah, just more. You know, I think myth is probably the one that summed it up best if we don't need a new gun every other week, you know, which is something that Fortnight did I want to say at least once a month? They had a new gun?  And then once a month they had a new item. So the flow of items seemed really or the flow of new content seemed really good, but they always mixed it up one time. It was a gun the next time it was an item the next time it was you know, something and building, you know, they always rotate it. And so that's kind of our problem right now. Is that maybe what they're trying to focus on is getting big patches when honestly little patches are just fine.  Size Doesn't Matter. Mmm-hmm. That's insane tells me I don't believe her because she looks away when she says it. Yeah if they look away to the left or right there always lying. So guys be be careful about that. All right, so you guys let us know what you're thinking you can go to at Apex Legends cast on Twitter or Apex Legends Hub cast at gmail.com. You can let us know.  Let's move on to our deep die.  Hey guys, let me tell you about a bite-sized podcast.

You can join the conversation by following the lore party of video game podcast on Spotify.  Alright, this week's Deep dive. We're going to be covering octane our newest character in Apex Legends. Now again, all this information is going to come from Pro game guides. So go ahead and give them a click. Now. This one's going to be a little bit interesting because along with the release of the character respawn also released his story, which I'm going to read for you because I think it's very cool and very interesting because it directly ties this character and the game to Titanfall, you know, we already know this is in the TitanFall universe, but it's also just kind  A pretty funny story. So octane he's going to be the adrenaline. Junkie. Now the story of octane is one day Octavio. Silva was bored. In fact, he was bored most days are to the preoccupied CEOs of silver Pharmaceuticals and wanting for nothing and wanting for nothing in life. He entertained himself by performing death-defying stunts and posting Hollow vids of them for his fans to gawk over. So this day he decided to set the course record for a nearby Gauntlet by launching himself across the Finish Line using a grenade.  And again Gauntlet from Titanfall 2 if you guys haven't played it or it's been a while since you play the campaign as he lay in triage hours later the doctors informed him that the Damage Done to his legs meant his Daredevil days were over that didn't sit well with Octavio who turned to an old friend for help AJ Chi who he guilted into forging in order to replace his legs with bionic ones suddenly able to repair his limbs at a moment's notice. Octavio decided Petty online stunts weren't enough the ultimate adrenaline rush.  The Apex games was his calling now. He's hoping to become an apex Champion doing the most incredible death-defying moves anyone's ever seen maybe in the arena. He won't be so bored.  So yeah, that was a story of octane. I wanted to read that for you guys because I think it's really funny. The fact of the reason why he has these robot legs is because he tried to get the record time by launching himself over the gauntlet with a grenade. All right. So for octane's Passive ability, that's going to be his Swift mend while not taking damage octane restores one Health, every two seconds now in general, this is an okay passive ability, but what it's a direct correlation to is going to  His tactical now his tactical is going to be his stem. Now with the stem. You move 30% faster for six seconds costs Health to use but while it's active octane is affected less by attacks that cause slow down gives you two second recharge as well. So with the stem, of course, you're going to move about 30% faster, which is going to help you get from point A to point B, and we'll cover that more here in a little bit on the tips and tricks. But again, his passive ability is going to be a direct effect of his tactical.  So since it takes away Health using the stem, when you're not in action, you're going to regain that Health back automatically, so it's going to be a slow charge but you won't have to use a health kit. Every time you have to use the Tactical.  Now for his ultimate ability that's going to be the launch pad with the launch pad, you'll deploy jump pad that catapults players through the air takes 90 seconds to recharge now. It doesn't launch you as far as you think it's more for when you're already engaging with an enemy and you need to get height on them or Escape. Now the biggest problem with this is that anyone can use this. So if in fact you are being chased they will be following right behind you so very similar to wraiths Ultimate ability with her with her port.  Anyone can go through them. So if you try to make an escape with the Launchpad just make sure you're looking behind you because someone's probably using that to get to where you're going as well overall great abilities on octane. I remember when we first were covering him. We were a little skeptical especially with his Launch Pad but so far in gameplay. It's a very fun character to play as you know, there's nothing really there's not anything really that's being dramatically different from the other characters, but this character is definitely for  Or you speed demons, especially you guys who used stem a lot in Titanfall 2. This is definitely going to be your character now for some tips and tricks for octane. There are a few he's a newer characters. So we're steadily growing our knowledge of octane and how to use has different abilities. But here's just a few just to give you kind of a frame of reference now with the stem use it pretty frequently. It's got a very short cooldown rate and you'll end up recovering your health through your passive ability. Like I said earlier this also goes for when you're traveling around.  Or are running in and out of battle. So stem variety of uses for it use it if you need to make up ground like if you're caught in the circle.  And you're caught outside the circle make sure you use that stem to get you faster to where you need to be or if your teammates just up and left you you're playing with a bunch of randos use that stem to help get you from point A to point B. Now the problem with octane as a character is he and a couple other Legends are definitely the type that you could categorize as being better in a Solo instance. So if you're not playing as an octane, if you're playing with a bunch of randos and someone's playing as an octane, make sure you watch what  Doing because with octane his speed ability that that random can very easily just get away from you and your team and go do his own thing and you wouldn't be none the wiser. So with octane just be sure if you're not playing as him if someone else's just see what they're doing. If you're the type that's going to get on the mic and be like, hey, we need help just make sure you're managing that now while you're under the influence of stem. It looks like one of your hands is occupied. So you might not be able to aim down the sights. This isn't the case though. You can a  Same as normal if you're using the stem. Now, of course, you just have a needle that's coming out of your chest right there, but it's just a visual thing. Now for the Launchpad ability. It's good for surprising enemies by quickly dropping it and jumping over them or on top of a hard-to-reach area. Now using this it's going to be faster than climbing over a wall so you can definitely get the jump on someone that's waiting for you on the other side in and waiting for you to climb you can easily get up there a lot faster with the launch pad and just give them a better form of surprise and bring down.  Our on them now something to also keep in mind and if this is out of date, I apologize but there was a recent thing with Gibraltar Shield were character players were beginning to realize you can stick things to it the Launchpad being one of them. So that's definitely something if you are playing with the team that's got an octane and a Gibraltar try throwing that jump pad on to Gibraltar shield and help push you farther than where you need to be. There's a lot of really really good uses for the launch pad.  Especially if you're the type that's really into trick shots quick scoping things like that. There's a whole Litany of things that you can do with this shield. Now this isn't necessarily a tip, but it's definitely something that's entertaining to say the least. So with the other characters if you need to run faster, obviously whole triangle or hold y or on the keyboard, press the corresponding button to tuck away your weapon so you can run faster now with octane if you do that with him, what he'll do is he'll hold up.  Hand like it's a finger gun and just run and it's a very funny thing to see especially if you're you're the character because it's just kind of a funny Amusement thing in the middle of a battle. But also if you are playing with someone who's an octane watch how they run because it's very fun. Like it always gives me a chuckle anytime. I'm playing with someone who's octane. I just I'll just watch them run because just the the the animation is just it's just it's just incredibly funny. I don't know if that's because of his pneumatic legs or what  it's just it's very fun to watch. Other than that. Like I said octane is definitely the character to play as if you were the speed demon type person someone who's always needed to get from point A to point B and just looking for a rush in the middle of the game. You can't look any farther than octane. All right. So that's everything you're going to want to know to be a good octane main. All right, and we have just a quick update on something. I mean, I guess this could technically be coaching Champions, but  Was a quick update and that is two weeks ago now right two weeks ago. Now we had a we had a coaching Champions where we talked about the ammos and the different special abilities each one of those hat and apparently according to a respawn developer. That is completely fabricated. All right. I want to thank Colton for bringing this to my attention because I did not see the specific tweets that he was talking about and thank you for bringing up in a really nice way.  So yeah, apparently light ammo doesn't shred through Shields like we thought we did Heavy ammo doesn't slow down. Well, actually the quote was that all ammo slows down people and energy does not have as big of a drop or whatever but it's not really like a special ability. It seems like so the main ones were definitely the light ammo in the heavy ammo because you know, we thought they shred through them and personally I got it from  YouTube video now that I found out it's not true. I'm almost kind of glad I forgot to leave in the leave in the description the because that particular week we had a description for the the aim training where you know, you're training yourself to aim better. Whatever we put the we'd put the you know the thing in for that but I totally forgot to put in the thing for the other side the other YouTube video, but now that it's not right. It's like oh wow.  Well, you know, I don't know if this guy's guy was malicious in any way or whatever, but you know, it does seem kind of like well dang it, you know any happen I can see where people were coming from just because most weapons that are going to be using live ammo are the very fast either submachine guns or assault rifles sure. I can see how someone could extrapolate that it shreds 3mo because you're firing at a fast at a higher rate, right? I'll partner obviously a lmg but I think  Interesting that I think the whole thing with the energy ammo is is just a physics thing, you know laser. Yeah ammunition energy ammunition. It doesn't have an actual physical bullet that's coming out of it. So it's straight energy coming out. So obviously that's not going to have a drop a drop rate or a high drop rate enough drop rate compared to the other guns. Yeah, that one's still kind of true. But the other ones definitely I could see where people could gather that just based on physics and  Firing rate, but yeah apparently from respawn. That's that's that's a technical foul. Yeah, it was something I wanted to bring up because you know, we reported on it and you know, we poured it on it as fact or whatever. I thought it was fact when I saw the video I was like, oh well, yeah, that makes sense. Okay, cool. Cool cool cool. And then I was like so excited and we even talked about loadouts on the next hop up and how like my loadouts have completely changed my  Look on life is just so much better now. And so yeah, like apparently it's not true and it's just like whoa. Well, I was I was Bamboozled Bamboozled. Okay. So after we finished recording Jason schreier tweeted out something that we thought was very pertinent something that we wanted to add into the show because it directly talks about what we covered in our topic of the week. So I'm going to read this tweet from you go ahead and give him  a like on Twitter go look up Jason schreier so you can give him that like but he tweets out a response from respawn in terms of talking about the frequency of content coming out and things like that. So from respond, they say we know that in addition to addressing issues with the game. Everyone is hungry for us to add new content the studio culture that we worked hard to cultivate and the health of our team are very important. We take those things into account when we discuss our content roadmap the production schedule and the frequency in which we can update the game.  Our long-term goal is to ensure Apex. Legends always feels alive and thriving with a focus on quality of content over novelty or speed of release at the same time. We want to maintain our culture as a development team and avoid crunch that can quickly lead to burnout or worse. So that's great for a developer to say 100% It's awesome that respond came out and said this and hopefully that'll calm down a lot of people in terms of why aren't you putting out this content? Well, they're telling you why they're telling you they don't want to overwork their staff.  That they want to appease you guys as much as they possibly can but also they want to make sure that the people that they have to create the games that you love aren't going to get burned out are going to be able to see their families and are going to just do what they can to better their health. So that's great for respond to say and we wanted to just add this into the show because we think it's very important when developers come out and say things like this, especially for response, so go respawn.  All right, and there's just one more thing that we wanted to bring up there is going to be a slight restructuring of the show. Now that we are officially done with all the Champions. We've pretty much gone through all the rankings ranking our zones ranking our weapons ranking, you know characters now that we've kind of gotten through all that we wanted to kind of restructure and so now our weekly show is going to turn into a biweekly show and this is just going to be so that  No, we don't run this into the ground. We still want to make content for you guys. We still want to be there for you guys, but we're going to start doing it on a bi-weekly basis. Idealistically. What we'll try to do is have at least try to give you something at least once a week. So one week you have a hop up one week. You have a hub cast because with the hop up we can still be very conversational and hopefully get more guests on and be able just to kind of have a good conversation, right?  Whereas, you know with Hub cast we're trying to give you all the information we can give you deep Dives and things like that. So with us covering all of our deep Dives now with all of the other characters, like Nick was saying, you know, we're basically need to figure something else out, you know. Yeah to to make sure we can still give you the content that we want and the content that you guys, you know deserve to have so from now on typically, you'll have a hop up one week and a hub cast the next that's the form so we are still technically weekly, I guess that was probably misleading of me.  We are still technically weekly. It's just that the Hub cast proper will be bi-weekly and the Hop cop up cast will be bi-weekly. So now instead of having to a week, you're only going to have the one and now I'll probably just be better in general for you know content creating. Yeah, so we wanted to give you guys a heads up, you know, so you're not freaking out like Hey, where's this episode and you know, you know trying to figure out what's going on. So we wanted to we wanted you guys to hear from the horse's mouth that hey, you know, we're working on things trying to get some more stuff together.  Weather and see what all we can provide for you guys. Definitely. So I think that's going to be it for us today. Thank you guys so much for joining us. If you want to write in you can write into us at Apex Legends Hub cast at gmail.com or Apex Legends cast on Twitter. If you like what you heard about the nerd radio, we're really excited about that. The episodes are going to be in June. So let us know what you think about it, you know, let us know any ideas you have any kind of feedback you have  Let us know in our comments or anything Discord obviously will always be in the description or on the top tweet on Twitter. Alright guys, so I was your host Nick and I was your host Nate and we'll see you down in Kings Canyon where it's gonna be Legend.\"]]}\n"

            "[[\"Hey guys, this is Nick before we got started with the show proper. We wanted to share something with you that we've been working on enjoy. Hello, I'm Nick and I'm Nate. We are threatened X3 Productions. Tell me if this sounds familiar. I used to listen to radio all the time either driving or on in the background at home. But after a while, I started listening less and less the DJ's just didn't talk about things that I was interested in mainly gossip like who's getting married who cheated on.  Who and oh, is that a baby bump but as a super nerve there was just no topics. I liked hearing about movies were mainly good or bad. No in-depth talks and video games were the worst if they were brought up at all. It was almost guaranteed to be negative. I didn't really mind the music brakes but the ad seemed to go on forever. So I switched to podcasts. I got the topics that I cared about and adds didn't overstay their welcome. So what if we could have the best of both worlds, that's where we come in.  Introducing the national nerd Net radio direct or nerd radio for short topics, you love from podcast, but music curated by the community and best of all, no ads only short sponsor reads. So if you to have switched to podcasts and miss the music and communities you get from a radio station, then check out nerd now with your help. We can make this happen. Come join us for eight hours samples every Friday in June if you like what you hear and you would like to support us you can help us make this dream a reality nerd.  Radio, you're stopped for music video games movies and so much more.  Alright guys, that's our big announcement. Hope you are excited as excited as we are to bring this to you. Now. Let's get started with the show Welcome Legends to the hub cast your central hub for everything Apex a podcast by fans for fans tips and tricks deep Dives and everything. You need to know from your first drop to that last head pop a dairy a legendary. What's up?  Jen's and welcome back to the hub cast. I am one of your host Nick.  And I'm Nate. I thought he was gonna intro me but I have Nate 10 episodes in and we're already taken a dance form s yeah. No. Yeah, whatever. All right, before we go into Kings Canyon. Let's get some grinding out of the way. You can check us out on Twitter at Apex Legends cast on Twitter or Apex Legends Hub cast at gmail.com for our email as of right now. We are at  87 so we're really close to 200 if we can get all the way up to 250. I'd like to do a giveaway. So share it to everybody, you know, or if you've listened to us for a while now and you haven't gone on to our Twitter go ahead and go on to our Twitter or you can go onto our Discord which will always be in the description or on a tweet pin to the top of the account. You can also check out our production company, which is thread X3 Productions at gmail.com or at  Tx3 Productions on Twitter when CH you can always figure out updates for that new radio that we're talking about that nerd radio. So let's jump into things. We're going to actually go straight to our topic of the week. Alright guys. So topic of the week. I always try to figure out you know,  Is everybody actually talking about last week people seem to be talking about there's not enough to do and this week There's been like a couple of different videos of is Apex dying and there is a couple of these a couple of weeks ago a couple of these a couple weeks ago and I kind of just didn't pay attention to them because it just seems like a fad, you know what I mean? It just seems like oh, well, you know this game is x amount old. So that means it has to be dying and it  just seemed like noise and it also just seemed like personal opinions, but then they started coming out with like upper-echelon came out with one and inside gaming came out with one and they specifically went into like the numbers of it the numbers at the beginning the numbers now and you know and things like that. So kind of wanted to talk about that try to hit like all the Avenues not just like, oh, we hate it and everything and that's definitely a disclaimer we have to talk about  Because any time we start talking in a sort of negative way. We can sometimes be categorized as complaining and that's one thing. I just want to make sure you guys know that you know, hey, we love the game. We still love the game. We still like playing it and this is just some critical things that we've seen being said about it not just from us but from the overall community and so that's why we're going to try to cover kind of all sides of it today and really figure out you know, what's  Going on would you agree absolutely absolutely would agree.  So so other than the other than the upper echelon, and like Insider Gaming's the main things that they were pointing out as like there's a big spike of streamers and people watching it on Twitch and nowadays. It's not so much. Yeah, it's those parts of the videos are definitely part of the conversation because of course the they're breaking down the actual numbers of everything the statistics and things like that giving you the facts.  All information on the situation maybe not necessarily a lot of content behind it in terms of what the other Gamers think but if we're there talking specifically math and factors and things like that. So that's why it's an important thing to talk about because you know, of course everyone has their opinion on the game, but this is statistics here, you know, so it's they're just pointing out that hey it's not doing as well as it probably should do to how good the game is.  Yeah. Yeah, and I do feel like it's also such a weird discrepancy that it did kind of blow up and it did get just so much recognition. I mean 50 million and a quarter of the time that it took for tonight to get 50 million. And so then it just kind of dropped off to such a degree that it's actually kind of surprising, you know, when you look at the numbers now, I wonder and maybe this is just me apologizing for a  But I wonder if maybe maybe part of the reason is that it's not as fun to watch versus it's much funner to play. So maybe the reasons the twitch numbers are as high is because it's also just less or it's more fun to play but that does kind of seem like me like apologizing for it. And I mean one thing I pair pointed out like last week and in particular was the fact that like the main people who play this like 8:00.  Eight hours a day day after day after day after day six days a week. Those are people who are complaining about it and saying, you know going out to all their followers. So of course when they say that they're not going to play the game as much then obviously you're going to have their followers. They're going to like, oh, yeah, maybe I shouldn't play either so there is kind of that factor.  So leading into that one of the things that we're going to bring up is a topic and a response that was brought up by myth now myth tweeted that it was a couple different tweets. So the first one they read into each other. He says my thoughts about Apex content topic pushing out content for the sake of pushing out content is unhealthy and I completely agree with them on that front. I assume talking about the streamers and every all the other content creators. He then says but pacing out your content over an  Amount of time can create some very dangerous expectations that if not met can burn budget can burn Bridges very fast with your community. I think Apex doesn't need to do huge content updates. Like they might think they do but even just a few small things once every three to four weeks to keep players engaged wouldn't hurt content doesn't need to be a new item or hero. Yeah. And I mean, this is completely agreeable. I mean and I feel like he is you could definitely hear and in the  way he decided to present it that you know, hey, you know, I do like the shit. I do like the game. It's not that like, I hate it or anything and Ike I think as far as like him talking about like pushing out content for the sake of pushing out content, you know, it did seem like maybe in some ways like Fortnight blackout and other things they would just like here's a new skin. Here's a new this and they they do it. So frequently, I do feel like maybe it gave people an unhealthy.  Um, look at how fast content comes out. Now, you couple you couple this with the report that just came out about how people working on on Fortnight are working, you know anywhere from like sixty to a hundred hour weeks to get that content that was coming out constantly, you know Fortnight was like the king and that's what everybody's going to compare this to so when Fortnight at the same time that we  that we are right now Fortnight had already had patches like every week or every other week and they've been starting on season 2 not season 1 in the same amount of time that we're talking about with Apex, you know, but how much of that was at the expense of well, well, we need to work a hundred hours a week, you know, so I feel like he is he is myth at least, you know, he's hitting a pretty good balance where he's not saying that he wants  You know a new character every week. I mean even OverWatch going to do that and like blizzard is freaking huge. You know, it's probably I'd say comparable to Epic size or maybe even bigger. I mean, this is Blizzard and you know blizzard is just huge and they only put out a character like once a year or something like that. What's a Rosy or something like that? Yeah. So I mean like it makes sense and I do have to agree with them and I don't think personally it has anything to do with items.  Our Heroes I do feel like it just would be nice that something new is happening all the time, you know, and we've said it once I'll say it a thousand more times limited time modes, you know, like here's a mode here's a new thing. Here's the thing of the week that we can all talk about we can gather around the water cooler and talk about our experiences do we like it do we hate it? You know because even in that sense, even if limited time mode comes out and nobody likes it. It's still getting them too.  To try it out. It's still getting them to log on. Obviously. You can't have too many l TMS and that are bad in a row because then you know, that's just real bad marketing. But what I'm trying to say is that just getting stuff out on a regular basis or you know, bi-weekly basis is a good thing, you know, and it's and it's just the fact that when you have internet heads and they're able to Crunch the numbers and they look at what Fortnight done and what Apex is done.  You know like your your average people like I'd say me and you you know, your average person is going to look at that and be like well, yeah, but that's Fortnight. This is Apex. They're trying to create something different here and we're able to see that but then your every man your casuals like the people who maybe you know, don't main one game they play Everything which is good. Obviously, that's not a bad thing. But I'm saying that they don't really care too much about the success or failure of Apex. But yet that's all they talk about is the success.  Failure of Apex because it gets them clicks. It gets them views it gets them, you know, notoriety or whatever but that that can be detrimental to the overall, you know message. Yeah, and I think were and I actually really enjoy this we're having a constant conversation in the community revolving Apec evolving around revolving around Apex in terms of different things that are either critiques or just people saying hey, like look at this. Let's have a conversation about  What each individual person thinks is going on. So like there's a lot of different conversations that are going to go on this topic myth really being the start. I think very poignant and to into a tea as far as his side of what's going on with the game. There are some other things that popped up on on the subreddit on the Apex Legend subreddit that one of them in particular says is titled unpopular opinion. The game isn't dying. You've probably played too much. So this which was sort of my  Stan's last week when I was all like stop playing this in the game. So damn right which I think this point of view ties into myths very well. We can cover a good bit of this but he in a very much appreciate you Cohen underscored Dev on Reddit. He puts a tldr at the beginning that says how many hours we used to pour into shooter games like Team Fortress 2 and Counter-Strike without any goals to strive for other than to have fun when  those gays when those games became temporarily boring you moved on and came back later to enjoy it just as much if you're feeling bored with this game do that like go and play something else or just and come back or just enjoy the game for what it is which again I think is very poignant. And he actually that's that's a brilliant thought that I hadn't thought about with games like Titan and this this completely like contradicts what I said last week, but I didn't think about it in this light we  Games like Team Fortress 2 in Counter-Strike people play those games for years, like possibly ten years. There's don't plan on they're still playing it and there's nothing really to strive for other than to just have fun in the game other than to get good Sun exactly other than to get good and last week when I talked about this I was talking about how I wish that there was something like a carrot on the end of the stick for me, like just something visual that I can see right, right. You know, it just is Apex that kind of game. Is it that kind of game that you can play?  Over and over again just have fun. And this I actually think is a conversation about Battle Royale games to most people this is the new Evolution of games like Counter-Strike and Team Fortress 2 for me Point good point the player that I am. This is why I've said before that this is a reason why I really would like singles or you know singles are Duo's. So those are Duo's in Apex is because like prime example, I've played it within the past 12 hours. I just I was just in the mood to play shooter.  So I jumped on Titanfall 2 because it's a self-contained I can play a match to match basis. And I'm only relying on my skill not relying on anybody else's I was having an absolute blast. I started playing that game when it came out. You know, I played it a lot more heavily six months to a year later and I'm still regularly playing it just because I have a lot of fun with it now for battle royales in general for me personally. I don't get that same enjoyment, you know when I would play Fortnight whenever it was popular for a while.  While it's just wasn't my kind of game. I I'm not the type of person who's going to play Battle royales consistently. I'm looking for a different experience. So that definitely it's it brings up an interesting topic of is Apex that kind of game. Is it going to be a replacement of Team Fortress 2 or Counter-Strike innocence? We all we all know that nothing is going to replace those games. Those games are Classics, but you know now Battle Royale is the new basically generation of games like this that have are supposed to have a long  Gravity to them so but I mean the main part of is is it's not dying. You've played too much. I think that speaks volumes to the state that we're in right now with all these different content creators as they played Non-Stop and like Nick was saying they've probably played so much they've gotten everything or got everything they want and now they're waiting for something else and saying that that times boring is that necessarily true. I think that's subjective. I honestly think it's subjective, you know, there are people who are not very high level in the game that are still enjoying it.  Still Loving the game. So this whole thing is so multifaceted that it's it's it's a very interesting conversation of breakdown. Yeah, and I mean, I'm definitely I think I am kind of on I'm still I still agree with what I said last week as far as like and I think the best way to put it is if you're feeling bored, you know, go play a different game or enjoy what this or was this a or just enjoy the game for what it is and I do feel like that's one thing.  You know like when everybody even when you Nate, I love you. I love you. Don't worry. I'm not mad at you. Even when you bring up like solos and Duo's or whatever. That's one thing that I'm like that's not what it's for, but I am totally willing to just be like, you know, what? Yes. Okay, you can have solos and Duos but that is one thing that like until we do get that like just have fun with the game for what it is, you know, and so that is kind of a really good point in the sense that there are so many.  Any people who maybe just want this game to be something else or even should just be like a normal Battle Royale but it's like but that's why we fell in love with it in the first place. We didn't fall in love with this just because you know, we got to drop off of a drop ship, you know, go down to the Earth pick up a bunch of guns and then start shooting each other. We got we fell in love with this for all the subtleties for the characters for you know, the movement and everything.  That's why we fall fell in love with this game. So and I mean I can fully admit to not enjoying this game for what it was because you know, like I was putting way too much focus on like I have to be the best that I ever was and so if I'm not, you know pulling in the winds, then I'm just not going to have fun with the game and that was a really negative place to be in and so like I've kind of after that really bad week though. I was talking about a couple weeks ago.  I've been having more fun with the game in general, you know, and it was just pretty much to the point where like, you know, I play other games like World War Z just came out really really good game. If you like Left 4 Dead back and like back in the day. Try it out because it's really good. They just put out a tweet or whatever. They just sold like, you know, two million within the first two days or something. It's like well good, you know, and it's like I can go and I can I can go enjoy that and then I can come back to Apex and just have fun with it. Not not.  About the grind not worried about you know, well how what's my kill to death ratio? You know, I don't have to worry about that because I can just have fun with it and the same thing we got days gone coming out. Well by the time this is uploaded today that's coming out today. I got in game. I got so many things to worry about that. Just having fun with Apex sounds like a really good Prospect and I do want to Circle back to something you were bringing up. I think the perfect thing that they can do.  To help the longevity of the game at least in this current state that it's in is limited time modes 100% You know, you think about blackout blackout was popular from the beginning but you had a lot of people that are in the same state of it was kind of like, okay, we've been playing this for months now like what? Okay, like what and then they really started releasing limited time modes like snipers only rockets on with snipers and Rockets things like that. Yeah, and they added a new map, you know Alcatraz, so they are doing things that are helping this game prosper and keep bringing people pack.  Keep bringing people back now. I'll ask you a question. Do you feel like respond and Apex is doing the same thing with this game or do you think that they're just letting the game speak for itself saying hey, if you are wanting to play this game, you'll play the game because it's that good. Yeah. I don't know that's where that's where the difficult question comes because if that's what they want to do. Then that's their prerogative. However, the numbers don't lie and the numbers are telling us that  It's it's below a lot of get like if you go on to Twitch and you look at the viewership or whatever. It's like almost not even top 10. I want to say what's it's probably like number nine or something like that. And so funnily enough like League of Legends is now back up at the top even over Fortnight. So I thought that was like, oh, well, you know good for them. They were number one for a really long time. So it is hot games the top categories right now. I want which is fortnight grand theft in order Fortnight grandmother.  Theft Auto V League of Legends just chatting, which is cool. I did note which had that Pub G World of Warcraft the new expansion magic Counter-Strike Mortal Kombat 11 and days gone.  With the top three having a hundred seventy nine with Fortnight a hundred and thirteen thousand those were such as where's Apex then it's not on it's not on these first six or eight on popular categories. So yeah, I think the the list I was going off of was actually older. So now X is not on the frittata and the slider. Yeah, it's not even on the front page, you know, so like going back to the point then is the numbers don't lie. You want respawn to pave their own path.  But at the same time I won't respawn this is gonna sound really bad, but it's like but I won't respond to succeed and right now they're not succeeding as much as I would hate to admit it. They're not because when they're not even on the front page anymore that is a problem because being viewed is the best thing that they can do and I do feel like even though  even though I don't agree with with Ninja doctor disrespect, you know Drifter, even though I don't necessarily agree with them in the sense that there's just not enough to do when I played eight hours a day. And so that means that it's trash or I don't know I'm being way fishy sis here. But even even though I don't agree with that, however, those are kind of the people you need to keep excited because those are the people who talk about the game when the game starts.  Talked about less people start talking about other things. That's just how Humanity works.  Now something to be fair just to bring into the twitch conversation Fortnight did drop their Avengers in game mode today. So that probably has a lot to do with where with why that's so high apart from just what would you say? What would you say that the Avengers game mode is what's it called? Just had it and game.  Now limited time Mojo. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was being Skelly being facetious. I gotcha. I gotcha for the further clarification. Apex Legends right now on Twitch has 28 thousand viewers.  Like compared to and obviously that is right at the second of this recording. So maybe later tonight. It's going to jump back up to the triple digits. So please don't tweet us like well actually, yeah, so please don't do that. But at the time, you know, 11:36 am here in you know, Idaho as of the time of the recording that's what the numbers are at. That's not good and Pub G is anything 6000? Oh God.  It's getting beat by Pub by pube G. Yeah. Oh, that's so it's one of those again. We want we want to further just clarify. We are not this is not a complaint or anything. We are talking about factual numbers here. Like Nick said, please don't tweet it. It's be like, oh, well, actually, please don't do that. We're talking about what the numbers are right now in the numbers don't lie. It's not a saying Hey, Oh Pub Jews is better than Apex because it's showing more at that's not it in the slightest. I feel like  don't have to clarify this but I but I also feel like we also need to clarify that which is there's always going to be one person out there. Right? Right. So it's you know, and you have other parts of this argument of this whole conversation where people are like there was another post it said can we address the issues that really matter now for clarification? I'm not going to read all of these because some of these Deuce correct me if I'm wrong from what you read a lot of the sound Nick nitpicky. Do you like very nitpicky? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I can agree with that. Yeah.  There are some things that are interesting that you brought up like one of he has like a list of bugs and glitches to change new features and quality of life stuff that he would that this person would want to see in the game but one of them and terms of bugs, what was it? You said something about that. They just fell fix broken Pathfinder hitbox dead zones. So we don't know the clarification on that because they just fix something with Pathfinders hitbox. So is it broken? Yeah. Yeah and that  Kind of I can see what you mean by nitpicky because it's like I hate I really do I genuinely hate when somebody calls something broken because broken to me means that when I during one of the very first competitions ninja got stuck in midair and one of his friends had to pull off like a really cool move to you know, revive him or whatever that is broken that is broke.  But when a hitbox is slightly off or a hitbox isnt what you want it to be or maybe the fire rate of the you know, the are 301 is not good enough for you. That doesn't make it broken. I hate that that phrase in particular is so overused. You know, it's just it's so frustrating. Can we try to stop saying something's broken. It's not broken and needs to be fixed. Sure.  Or it can be altered. Let's let's put it that way because fix would imply that it's broken but it could it be altered could it mean made better? Of course, you know that's part of the game and part of the reason why we're talking about, you know, the state of the game is because like, of course it can always evolve.  Right and you know he I'm reading through this through this whole thread and there were a lot of things on here that I thought were interesting and I'll bring some of them up but some of them are just like very like literally very nitpicky like one. Wait. Wait, wait. Wait, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.  On Reddit on Reddit. Yeah on what is already know on one of their quality of life changes. They said something like this one. I agree with color-coded teammate traps like for caustic.  Okay, I can understand that. There was no like that was like see it through a wall or something. Maybe there is another one that said limit the amount of times a down teammate can ping. I was like no, I don't agree with that at all. Well, sometimes I can be annoying when someone's like yeah, so I can I can understand that, you know to a certain extent plus it's like they're almost more.  Useful when they're down. Yeah.  There was one in new feature section that he added that crate drops after level 100.  That could be something good. What do you mean crate?  I imagine I imagine fixing either getting crate drop. I mean, I don't know. This is from Reddit. I'm just really I'm just reading what's on here. Maybe he means Apex packs because I know they get super scarce. Once you're once you're in the app, that's what I kind of assumed. Maybe that's what it means. Okay, but there's things also like rework mirages ultimate and passive. I mean, I could see reworking his all you were already. Yeah. We were already kind of talking about that personally. Yeah. So I mean there's there's something there custom products and I thought  That big yes. Yeah. See see now the ones I could agree with is like the custom servers would be awesome. I mean we have a we have a community on Discord. It'd be awesome just a jump in with you guys and have some fun, you know, another one leaderboards. I don't personally care because I'm going to be at the bottom. Anyways, you know, but it like there's certain things that come with the leaderboard. It's not just a my number one in the world. It's also how many wins Total do I have how many kills  Total do I have and that's something that like I could see what they were trying to do as far as like, oh, here's all your wins with Gibraltar. Here's all your wins with Bangalore, but I want to know how many wins Total I have. I don't want to own one. I don't want to know how many with that character because me personally and I think there's probably a lot of you out there. But me personally I kind of switch it around part of that is because of the battle pass and how it gives you bonuses for playing as different characters, but then part of that also is  Is it depends on like who is on my team what they are? I never choose a character because I want to pay is that character? I choose a character based on the team Dynamic I didn't and I try to I try to mix it up to because I don't want to get too comfortable because then it's like, you know, you always want to stay on your feet or whatever, which I really saw it because I played a lot of Lifeline recently because no one's getting lifeline and I really enjoy playing his lifeline and that's I was Pathfinder race main for the  Longest time and now now lifelines in there because I just enjoy the gameplay that I have with her. Right? And so yeah, so then back to my point is like, you know, that's the game. They wanted to create they wanted to create a game where you're maybe switching around you can have fun with any Legend. It doesn't have to be one. However, a global win a global kill count is something I feel like anybody and everybody wants, you know, they want to know because even  even if we're just having fun with the game for what it is, we still want to know how we're progressing. You know what I mean? And yeah sure how many kills were getting with wraith is fine. But then if we switch over to another character it D incentivizes us to switch to that character when we see the kills are a fraction of what we have with The Wraith.  Right, I agree. I've always enjoyed and Shooters being able to look at my full combat record and see what my full stats are instead of like individual as which I see why they're doing that at the same time like universalize it like make it a little bit easier. Yeah, just more. You know, I think myth is probably the one that summed it up best if we don't need a new gun every other week, you know, which is something that Fortnight did I want to say at least once a month? They had a new gun?  And then once a month they had a new item. So the flow of items seemed really or the flow of new content seemed really good, but they always mixed it up one time. It was a gun the next time it was an item the next time it was you know, something and building, you know, they always rotate it. And so that's kind of our problem right now. Is that maybe what they're trying to focus on is getting big patches when honestly little patches are just fine.  Size Doesn't Matter. Mmm-hmm. That's insane tells me I don't believe her because she looks away when she says it. Yeah if they look away to the left or right there always lying. So guys be be careful about that. All right, so you guys let us know what you're thinking you can go to at Apex Legends cast on Twitter or Apex Legends Hub cast at gmail.com. You can let us know.  Let's move on to our deep die.

Now again, all this information is going to come from Pro game guides. So go ahead and give them a click. Now. This one's going to be a little bit interesting because along with the release of the character respawn also released his story, which I'm going to read for you because I think it's very cool and very interesting because it directly ties this character and the game to Titanfall, you know, we already know this is in the TitanFall universe, but it's also just kind  A pretty funny story. So octane he's going to be the adrenaline. Junkie. Now the story of octane is one day Octavio. Silva was bored. In fact, he was bored most days are to the preoccupied CEOs of silver Pharmaceuticals and wanting for nothing and wanting for nothing in life. He entertained himself by performing death-defying stunts and posting Hollow vids of them for his fans to gawk over. So this day he decided to set the course record for a nearby Gauntlet by launching himself across the Finish Line using a grenade.  And again Gauntlet from Titanfall 2 if you guys haven't played it or it's been a while since you play the campaign as he lay in triage hours later the doctors informed him that the Damage Done to his legs meant his Daredevil days were over that didn't sit well with Octavio who turned to an old friend for help AJ Chi who he guilted into forging in order to replace his legs with bionic ones suddenly able to repair his limbs at a moment's notice. Octavio decided Petty online stunts weren't enough the ultimate adrenaline rush.  The Apex games was his calling now. He's hoping to become an apex Champion doing the most incredible death-defying moves anyone's ever seen maybe in the arena. He won't be so bored.  So yeah, that was a story of octane. I wanted to read that for you guys because I think it's really funny. The fact of the reason why he has these robot legs is because he tried to get the record time by launching himself over the gauntlet with a grenade. All right. So for octane's Passive ability, that's going to be his Swift mend while not taking damage octane restores one Health, every two seconds now in general, this is an okay passive ability, but what it's a direct correlation to is going to  His tactical now his tactical is going to be his stem. Now with the stem. You move 30% faster for six seconds costs Health to use but while it's active octane is affected less by attacks that cause slow down gives you two second recharge as well. So with the stem, of course, you're going to move about 30% faster, which is going to help you get from point A to point B, and we'll cover that more here in a little bit on the tips and tricks. But again, his passive ability is going to be a direct effect of his tactical.  So since it takes away Health using the stem, when you're not in action, you're going to regain that Health back automatically, so it's going to be a slow charge but you won't have to use a health kit. Every time you have to use the Tactical.  Now for his ultimate ability that's going to be the launch pad with the launch pad, you'll deploy jump pad that catapults players through the air takes 90 seconds to recharge now. It doesn't launch you as far as you think it's more for when you're already engaging with an enemy and you need to get height on them or Escape. Now the biggest problem with this is that anyone can use this. So if in fact you are being chased they will be following right behind you so very similar to wraiths Ultimate ability with her with her port.  Anyone can go through them. So if you try to make an escape with the Launchpad just make sure you're looking behind you because someone's probably using that to get to where you're going as well overall great abilities on octane. I remember when we first were covering him. We were a little skeptical especially with his Launch Pad but so far in gameplay. It's a very fun character to play as you know, there's nothing really there's not anything really that's being dramatically different from the other characters, but this character is definitely for  Or you speed demons, especially you guys who used stem a lot in Titanfall 2. This is definitely going to be your character now for some tips and tricks for octane. There are a few he's a newer characters. So we're steadily growing our knowledge of octane and how to use has different abilities. But here's just a few just to give you kind of a frame of reference now with the stem use it pretty frequently. It's got a very short cooldown rate and you'll end up recovering your health through your passive ability. Like I said earlier this also goes for when you're traveling around.  Or are running in and out of battle. So stem variety of uses for it use it if you need to make up ground like if you're caught in the circle.  And you're caught outside the circle make sure you use that stem to get you faster to where you need to be or if your teammates just up and left you you're playing with a bunch of randos use that stem to help get you from point A to point B. Now the problem with octane as a character is he and a couple other Legends are definitely the type that you could categorize as being better in a Solo instance. So if you're not playing as an octane, if you're playing with a bunch of randos and someone's playing as an octane, make sure you watch what  Doing because with octane his speed ability that that random can very easily just get away from you and your team and go do his own thing and you wouldn't be none the wiser. So with octane just be sure if you're not playing as him if someone else's just see what they're doing. If you're the type that's going to get on the mic and be like, hey, we need help just make sure you're managing that now while you're under the influence of stem. It looks like one of your hands is occupied. So you might not be able to aim down the sights. This isn't the case though. You can a  Same as normal if you're using the stem. Now, of course, you just have a needle that's coming out of your chest right there, but it's just a visual thing. Now for the Launchpad ability. It's good for surprising enemies by quickly dropping it and jumping over them or on top of a hard-to-reach area. Now using this it's going to be faster than climbing over a wall so you can definitely get the jump on someone that's waiting for you on the other side in and waiting for you to climb you can easily get up there a lot faster with the launch pad and just give them a better form of surprise and bring down.  Our on them now something to also keep in mind and if this is out of date, I apologize but there was a recent thing with Gibraltar Shield were character players were beginning to realize you can stick things to it the Launchpad being one of them. So that's definitely something if you are playing with the team that's got an octane and a Gibraltar try throwing that jump pad on to Gibraltar shield and help push you farther than where you need to be. There's a lot of really really good uses for the launch pad.  Especially if you're the type that's really into trick shots quick scoping things like that. There's a whole Litany of things that you can do with this shield. Now this isn't necessarily a tip, but it's definitely something that's entertaining to say the least. So with the other characters if you need to run faster, obviously whole triangle or hold y or on the keyboard, press the corresponding button to tuck away your weapon so you can run faster now with octane if you do that with him, what he'll do is he'll hold up.  Hand like it's a finger gun and just run and it's a very funny thing to see especially if you're you're the character because it's just kind of a funny Amusement thing in the middle of a battle. But also if you are playing with someone who's an octane watch how they run because it's very fun. Like it always gives me a chuckle anytime. I'm playing with someone who's octane. I just I'll just watch them run because just the the the animation is just it's just it's just incredibly funny. I don't know if that's because of his pneumatic legs or what  it's just it's very fun to watch. Other than that. Like I said octane is definitely the character to play as if you were the speed demon type person someone who's always needed to get from point A to point B and just looking for a rush in the middle of the game. You can't look any farther than octane. All right. So that's everything you're going to want to know to be a good octane main. All right, and we have just a quick update on something. I mean, I guess this could technically be coaching Champions, but  Was a quick update and that is two weeks ago now right two weeks ago. Now we had a we had a coaching Champions where we talked about the ammos and the different special abilities each one of those hat and apparently according to a respawn developer. That is completely fabricated. All right. I want to thank Colton for bringing this to my attention because I did not see the specific tweets that he was talking about and thank you for bringing up in a really nice way.  So yeah, apparently light ammo doesn't shred through Shields like we thought we did Heavy ammo doesn't slow down. Well, actually the quote was that all ammo slows down people and energy does not have as big of a drop or whatever but it's not really like a special ability. It seems like so the main ones were definitely the light ammo in the heavy ammo because you know, we thought they shred through them and personally I got it from  YouTube video now that I found out it's not true. I'm almost kind of glad I forgot to leave in the leave in the description the because that particular week we had a description for the the aim training where you know, you're training yourself to aim better. Whatever we put the we'd put the you know the thing in for that but I totally forgot to put in the thing for the other side the other YouTube video, but now that it's not right. It's like oh wow.  Well, you know, I don't know if this guy's guy was malicious in any way or whatever, but you know, it does seem kind of like well dang it, you know any happen I can see where people were coming from just because most weapons that are going to be using live ammo are the very fast either submachine guns or assault rifles sure. I can see how someone could extrapolate that it shreds 3mo because you're firing at a fast at a higher rate, right? I'll partner obviously a lmg but I think  Interesting that I think the whole thing with the energy ammo is is just a physics thing, you know laser. Yeah ammunition energy ammunition. It doesn't have an actual physical bullet that's coming out of it. So it's straight energy coming out. So obviously that's not going to have a drop a drop rate or a high drop rate enough drop rate compared to the other guns. Yeah, that one's still kind of true. But the other ones definitely I could see where people could gather that just based on physics and  Firing rate, but yeah apparently from respawn. That's that's that's a technical foul. Yeah, it was something I wanted to bring up because you know, we reported on it and you know, we poured it on it as fact or whatever. I thought it was fact when I saw the video I was like, oh well, yeah, that makes sense. Okay, cool. Cool cool cool. And then I was like so excited and we even talked about loadouts on the next hop up and how like my loadouts have completely changed my  Look on life is just so much better now. And so yeah, like apparently it's not true and it's just like whoa. Well, I was I was Bamboozled Bamboozled. Okay. So after we finished recording Jason schreier tweeted out something that we thought was very pertinent something that we wanted to add into the show because it directly talks about what we covered in our topic of the week. So I'm going to read this tweet from you go ahead and give him  a like on Twitter go look up Jason schreier so you can give him that like but he tweets out a response from respawn in terms of talking about the frequency of content coming out and things like that. So from respond, they say we know that in addition to addressing issues with the game. Everyone is hungry for us to add new content the studio culture that we worked hard to cultivate and the health of our team are very important. We take those things into account when we discuss our content roadmap the production schedule and the frequency in which we can update the game.  Our long-term goal is to ensure Apex. Legends always feels alive and thriving with a focus on quality of content over novelty or speed of release at the same time. We want to maintain our culture as a development team and avoid crunch that can quickly lead to burnout or worse. So that's great for a developer to say 100% It's awesome that respond came out and said this and hopefully that'll calm down a lot of people in terms of why aren't you putting out this content? Well, they're telling you why they're telling you they don't want to overwork their staff.  That they want to appease you guys as much as they possibly can but also they want to make sure that the people that they have to create the games that you love aren't going to get burned out are going to be able to see their families and are going to just do what they can to better their health. So that's great for respond to say and we wanted to just add this into the show because we think it's very important when developers come out and say things like this, especially for response, so go respawn.  All right, and there's just one more thing that we wanted to bring up there is going to be a slight restructuring of the show. Now that we are officially done with all the Champions. We've pretty much gone through all the rankings ranking our zones ranking our weapons ranking, you know characters now that we've kind of gotten through all that we wanted to kind of restructure and so now our weekly show is going to turn into a biweekly show and this is just going to be so that  No, we don't run this into the ground. We still want to make content for you guys. We still want to be there for you guys, but we're going to start doing it on a bi-weekly basis. Idealistically. What we'll try to do is have at least try to give you something at least once a week. So one week you have a hop up one week. You have a hub cast because with the hop up we can still be very conversational and hopefully get more guests on and be able just to kind of have a good conversation, right?  Whereas, you know with Hub cast we're trying to give you all the information we can give you deep Dives and things like that. So with us covering all of our deep Dives now with all of the other characters, like Nick was saying, you know, we're basically need to figure something else out, you know. Yeah to to make sure we can still give you the content that we want and the content that you guys, you know deserve to have so from now on typically, you'll have a hop up one week and a hub cast the next that's the form so we are still technically weekly, I guess that was probably misleading of me.  We are still technically weekly. It's just that the Hub cast proper will be bi-weekly and the Hop cop up cast will be bi-weekly. So now instead of having to a week, you're only going to have the one and now I'll probably just be better in general for you know content creating. Yeah, so we wanted to give you guys a heads up, you know, so you're not freaking out like Hey, where's this episode and you know, you know trying to figure out what's going on. So we wanted to we wanted you guys to hear from the horse's mouth that hey, you know, we're working on things trying to get some more stuff together.  Weather and see what all we can provide for you guys. Definitely. So I think that's going to be it for us today. Thank you guys so much for joining us. If you want to write in you can write into us at Apex Legends Hub cast at gmail.com or Apex Legends cast on Twitter. If you like what you heard about the nerd radio, we're really excited about that. The episodes are going to be in June. So let us know what you think about it, you know, let us know any ideas you have any kind of feedback you have  Let us know in our comments or anything Discord obviously will always be in the description or on the top tweet on Twitter. Alright guys, so I was your host Nick and I was your host Nate and we'll see you down in Kings Canyon where it's gonna be Legend.\"]]\n"

            "hey guys this is nick before we got started with the show proper we wanted to share something with you that weve been working on enjoy hello im nick and im nate we are threatened x productions tell me if this sounds familiar i used to listen to radio all the time either driving or on in the background at home but after a while i started listening less and less the djs just didnt talk about things that i was interested in mainly gossip like whos getting married who cheated on who and oh is that a baby bump but as a super nerve there was just no topics i liked hearing about movies were mainly good or bad no indepth talks and video games were the worst if they were brought up at all it was almost guaranteed to be negative i didnt really mind the music brakes but the ad seemed to go on forever so i switched to podcasts i got the topics that i cared about and adds didnt overstay their welcome so what if we could have the best of both worlds thats where we come in introducing the national nerd net radio direct or nerd radio for short topics you love from podcast but music curated by the community and best of all no ads only short sponsor reads so if you to have switched to podcasts and miss the music and communities you get from a radio station then check out nerd now with your help we can make this happen come join us for eight hours samples every friday in

grinding out of the way you can check us out on twitter at apex legends cast on twitter or apex legends hub cast at gmailcom for our email as of right now we are at so were really close to if we can get all the way up to id like to do a giveaway so share it to everybody you know or if youve listened to us for a while now and you havent gone on to our twitter go ahead and go on to our twitter or you can go onto our discord which will always be in the description or on a tweet pin to the top of the account you can also check out our production company which is thread x productions at gmailcom or at tx productions on twitter when ch you can always figure out updates for that new radio that were talking about that nerd radio so lets jump into things were going to actually go straight to our topic of the week alright guys so topic of the week i always try to figure out you know is everybody actually talking about last week people seem to be talking about theres not enough to do and this week theres been like a couple of different videos of is apex dying and there is a couple of these a couple of weeks ago a couple of these a couple weeks ago and i kind of just didnt pay attention to them because it just seems like a fad you know what i mean it just seems like oh well you know this game is x amount old so that means it has to be dying and it just seemed like noise and it also just seemed like personal opinions but then they started coming out with like upperechelon came out with one and inside gaming came out with one and they specifically went into like the numbers of it the numbers at the beginning the numbers now and you know and things like that so kind of wanted to talk about that try to hit like all the avenues not just like oh we hate it and everything and thats definitely a disclaimer we have to talk about because any time we start talking in a sort of negative way we can sometimes be categorized as complaining and thats one thing i just want to make sure you guys know that you know hey we love the game we still love the game we still like playing it and this is just some critical things that weve seen being said about it not just from us but from the overall community and so thats why were going to try to cover kind of all sides of it today and really figure out you know whats going on would you agree absolutely absolutely would agree so so other than the other than the upper echelon and like insider gamings the main things that they were pointing out as like theres a big spike of streamers and people watching it on twitch and nowadays its not so much yeah its those parts of the videos are definitely part of the conversation because of course the theyre breaking down the actual numbers of everything the statistics and things like that giving you the facts all information on the situation maybe not necessarily a lot of content behind it in terms of what the other gamers think but if were there talking specifically math and factors and things like that so thats why its an important thing to talk about because you know of course everyone has their opinion on the game but this is statistics here you know so its theyre just pointing out that hey its not doing as well as it probably should do to how good the game is yeah yeah and i do feel like its also such a weird discrepancy that it did kind of blow up and it did get just so much recognition i mean million and a quarter of the time that it took for tonight to get million and so then it just kind of dropped off to such a degree that its actually kind of surprising you know when you look at the numbers now i wonder and maybe this is just me apologizing for a but i wonder if maybe maybe part of the reason is that its not as fun to watch versus its much funner to play so maybe the reasons the twitch numbers are as high is because its also just less or its more fun to play but that does kind of seem like me like apologizing for it and i mean one thing i pair pointed out like last week and in particular was the fact that like the main people who play this like eight hours a day day after day after day after day six days a week those are people who are complaining about it and saying you know going out to all their followers so of course when they say that theyre not going to play the game as much then obviously youre going to have their followers theyre going to like oh yeah maybe i shouldnt play either so there is kind of that factor so leading into that one of the things that were going to bring up is a topic and a response that was brought up by myth now myth tweeted that it was a couple different tweets so the first one they read into each other he says my thoughts about apex content topic pushing out content for the sake of pushing out content is unhealthy and i completely agree with them on that front i assume talking about the streamers and every all the other content creators he then says but pacing out your content over an amount of time can create some very dangerous expectations that if not met can burn budget can burn bridges very fast with your community i think apex doesnt need to do huge content updates like they might think they do but even just a few small things once every three to four weeks to keep players engaged wouldnt hurt content doesnt need to be a new item or hero yeah and i mean this is completely agreeable i mean and i feel like he is you could definitely hear and in the way he decided to present it that you know hey you know i do like the shit i do like the game its not that like i hate it or anything and ike i think as far as like him talking about like pushing out content for the sake of pushing out content you know it did seem like maybe in some ways like fortnight blackout and other things they would just like heres a new skin heres a new this and they they do it so frequently i do feel like maybe it gave people an unhealthy um look at how fast content comes out now you couple you couple this with the report that just came out about how people working on on fortnight are working you know anywhere from like sixty to a hundred hour weeks to get that content that was coming out constantly you know fortnight was like the king and thats what everybodys going to compare this to so when fortnight at the same time that we that we are right now fortnight had already had patches like every week or every other week and theyve been starting on season not season in the same amount of time that were talking about with apex you know but how much of that was at the expense of well well we need to work a hundred hours a week you know so i feel like he is he is myth at least you know hes hitting a pretty good balance where hes not saying that he wants you know a new character every week i mean even overwatch going to do that and like blizzard is freaking huge you know its probably id say comparable to epic size or maybe even bigger i mean this is blizzard and you know blizzard is just huge and they only put out a character like once a year or something like that whats a rosy or something like that yeah so i mean like it makes sense and i do have to agree with them and i dont think personally it has anything to do with items our heroes i do feel like it just would be nice that something new is happening all the time you know and weve said it once ill say it a thousand more times limited time modes you know like heres a mode heres a new thing heres the thing of the week that we can all talk about we can gather around the water cooler and talk about our experiences do we like it do we hate it you know because even in that sense even if limited time mode comes out and nobody likes it its still getting them too to try it out its still getting them to log on obviously you cant have too many l tms and that are bad in a row because then you know thats just real bad marketing but what im trying to say is that just getting stuff out on a regular basis or you know biweekly basis is a good thing you know and its and its just the fact that when you have internet heads and theyre able to crunch the numbers and they look at what fortnight done and what apex is done you know like your your average people like id say me and you you know your average person is going to look at that and be like well yeah but thats fortnight this is apex theyre trying to create something different here and were able to see that but then your every man your casuals like the people who maybe you know dont main one game they play everything which is good obviously thats not a bad thing but im saying that they dont really care too much about the success or failure of apex but yet thats all they talk about is the success failure of apex because it gets them clicks it gets them views it gets them you know notoriety or whatever but that that can be detrimental to the overall you know message yeah and i think were and i actually really enjoy this were having a constant conversation in the community revolving apec evolving around revolving around apex in terms of different things that are either critiques or just people saying hey like look at this lets have a conversation about what each individual person thinks is going on so like theres a lot of different conversations that are going to go on this topic myth really being the start i think very poignant and to into a tea as far as his side of whats going on with the game there are some other things that popped up on on the subreddit on the apex legend subreddit that one of them in particular says is titled unpopular opinion the game isnt dying youve probably played too much so this which was sort of my stans last week when i was all like stop playing this in the game so damn right which i think this point of view ties into myths very well we can cover a good bit of this but he in a very much appreciate you cohen underscored dev on reddit he puts a tldr at the beginning that says how many hours we used to pour into shooter games like team fortress and counterstrike without any goals to strive for other than to have fun when those gays when those games became temporarily boring you moved on and came back later to enjoy it just as much if youre feeling bored with this game do that like go and play something else or just and come back or just enjoy the game for what it is which again i think is very poignant and he actually thats thats a brilliant thought that i hadnt thought about with games like titan and this this completely like contradicts what i said last week but i didnt think about it in this light we games like team fortress in counterstrike people play those games for years like possibly ten years theres dont plan on theyre still playing it and theres nothing really to strive for other than to just have fun in the game other than to get good sun exactly other than to get good and last week when i talked about this i was talking about how i wish that there was something like a carrot on the end of the stick for me like just something visual that i can see right right you know it just is apex that kind of game is it that kind of game that you can play over and over again just have fun and this i actually think is a conversation about battle royale games to most people this is the new evolution of games like counterstrike and team fortress for me point good point the player that i am this is why ive said before that this is a reason why i really would like singles or you know singles are duos so those are duos in apex is because like prime example ive played it within the past hours i just i was just in the mood to play shooter so i jumped on titanfall because its a selfcontained i can play a match to match basis and im only relying on my skill not relying on anybody elses i was having an absolute blast i started playing that game when it came out you know i played it a lot more heavily six months to a year later and im still regularly playing it just because i have a lot of fun with it now for battle royales in general for me personally i dont get that same enjoyment you know when i would play fortnight whenever it was popular for a while while its just wasnt my kind of game i im not the type of person whos going to play battle royales consistently im looking for a different experience so that definitely its it brings up an interesting topic of is apex that kind of game is it going to be a replacement of team fortress or counterstrike innocence we all we all know that nothing is going to replace those games those games are classics but you know now battle royale is the new basically generation of games like this that have are supposed to have a long gravity to them so but i mean the main part of is is its not dying youve played too much i think that speaks volumes to the state that were in right now with all these different content creators as they played nonstop and like nick was saying theyve probably played so much theyve gotten everything or got everything they want and now theyre waiting for something else and saying that that times boring is that necessarily true i think thats subjective i honestly think its subjective you know there are people who are not very high level in the game that are still enjoying it still loving the game so this whole thing is so multifaceted that its its its a very interesting conversation of breakdown yeah and i mean im definitely i think i am kind of on im still i still agree with what i said last week as far as like and i think the best way to put it is if youre feeling bored you know go play a different game or enjoy what this or was this a or just enjoy the game for what it is and i do feel like thats one thing you know like when everybody even when you nate i love you i love you dont worry im not mad at you even when you bring up like solos and duos or whatever thats one thing that im like thats not what its for but i am totally willing to just be like you know what yes okay you can have solos and duos but that is one thing that like until we do get that like just have fun with the game for what it is you know and so that is kind of a really good point in the sense that there are so many any people who maybe just want this game to be something else or even should just be like a normal battle royale but its like but thats why we fell in love with it in the first place we didnt fall in love with this just because you know we got to drop off of a drop ship you know go down to the earth pick up a bunch of guns and then start shooting each other we got we fell in love with this for all the subtleties for the characters for you know the movement and everything thats why we fall fell in love with this game so and i mean i can fully admit to not enjoying this game for what it was because you know like i was putting way too much focus on like i have to be the best that i ever was and so if im not you know pulling in the winds then im just not going to have fun with the game and that was a really negative place to be in and so like ive kind of after that really bad week though i was talking about a couple weeks ago ive been having more fun with the game in general you know and it was just pretty much to the point where like you know i play other games like world war z just came out really really good game if you like left dead back and like back in the day try it out because its really good they just put out a tweet or whatever they just sold like you know two million within the first two days or something its like well good you know and its like i can go and i can i can go enjoy that and then i can come back to apex and just have fun with it not not about the grind not worried about you know well how whats my kill to death ratio you know i dont have to worry about that because i can just have fun with it and the same thing we got days gone coming out well by the time this is uploaded today thats coming out today i got in game i got so many things to worry about that just having fun with apex sounds like a really good prospect and i do want to circle back to something you were bringing up i think the perfect thing that they can do to help the longevity of the game at least in this current state that its in is limited time modes you know you think about blackout blackout was popular from the beginning but you had a lot of people that are in the same state of it was kind of like okay weve been playing this for months now like what okay like what and then they really started releasing limited time modes like snipers only rockets on with snipers and rockets things like that yeah and they added a new map you know alcatraz so they are doing things that are helping this game prosper and keep bringing people pack keep bringing people back now ill ask you a question do you feel like respond and apex is doing the same thing with this game or do you think that theyre just letting the game speak for itself saying hey if you are wanting to play this game youll play the game because its that good yeah i dont know thats where thats where the difficult question comes because if thats what they want to do then thats their prerogative however the numbers dont lie and the numbers are telling us that its its below a lot of get like if you go on to twitch and you look at the viewership or whatever its like almost not even top i want to say whats its probably like number nine or something like that and so funnily enough like league of legends is now back up at the top even over fortnight so i thought that was like oh well you know good for them they were number one for a really long time so it is hot games the top categories right now i want which is fortnight grand theft in order fortnight grandmother theft auto v league of legends just chatting which is cool i did note which had that pub g world of warcraft the new expansion magic counterstrike mortal kombat and days gone with the top three having a hundred seventy nine with fortnight a hundred and thirteen thousand those were such as wheres apex then its not on its not on these first six or eight on popular categories so yeah i think the the list i was going off of was actually older so now x is not on the frittata and the slider yeah its not even on the front page you know so like going back to the point then is the numbers dont lie you want respawn to pave their own path but at the same time i wont respawn this is gonna sound really bad but its like but i wont respond to succeed and right now theyre not succeeding as much as i would hate to admit it theyre not because when theyre not even on the front page anymore that is a problem because being viewed is the best thing that they can do and i do feel like even though even though i dont agree with with ninja doctor disrespect you know drifter even though i dont necessarily agree with them in the sense that theres just not enough to do when i played eight hours a day and so that means that its trash or i dont know im being way fishy sis here but even even though i dont agree with that however those are kind of the people you need to keep excited because those are the people who talk about the game when the game starts talked about less people start talking about other things thats just how humanity works now something to be fair just to bring into the twitch conversation fortnight did drop their avengers in game mode today so that probably has a lot to do with where with why thats so high apart from just what would you say what would you say that the avengers game mode is whats it called just had it and game now limited time mojo oh yeah yeah yeah i was being skelly being facetious i gotcha i gotcha for the further clarification apex legends right now on twitch has thousand viewers like compared to and obviously that is right at the second of this recording so maybe later tonight its going to jump back up to the triple digits so please dont tweet us like well actually yeah so please dont do that but at the time you know am here in you know idaho as of the time of the recording thats what the numbers are at thats not good and pub g is anything oh god its getting beat by pub by pube g yeah oh thats so its one of those again we want we want to further just clarify we are not this is not a complaint or anything we are talking about factual numbers here like nick said please dont tweet it its be like oh well actually please dont do that were talking about what the numbers are right now in the numbers dont lie its not a saying hey oh pub jews is better than apex because its showing more at thats not it in the slightest i feel like dont have to clarify this but i but i also feel like we also need to clarify that which is theres always going to be one person out there right right so its you know and you have other parts of this argument of this whole conversation where people are like there was another post it said can we address the issues that really matter now for clarification im not going to read all of these because some of these deuce correct me if im wrong from what you read a lot of the sound nick nitpicky do you like very nitpicky yeah yeah yeah i can agree with that yeah there are some things that are interesting that you brought up like one of he has like a list of bugs and glitches to change new features and quality of life stuff that he would that this person would want to see in the game but one of them and terms of bugs what was it you said something about that they just fell fix broken pathfinder hitbox dead zones so we dont know the clarification on that because they just fix something with pathfinders hitbox so is it broken yeah yeah and that kind of i can see what you mean by nitpicky because its like i hate i really do i genuinely hate when somebody calls something broken because broken to me means that when i during one of the very first competitions ninja got stuck in midair and one of his friends had to pull off like a really cool move to you know revive him or whatever that is broken that is broke but when a hitbox is slightly off or a hitbox isnt what you want it to be or maybe the fire rate of the you know the are is not good enough for you that doesnt make it broken i hate that that phrase in particular is so overused you know its just its so frustrating can we try to stop saying somethings broken its not broken and needs to be fixed sure or it can be altered lets lets put it that way because fix would imply that its broken but it could it be altered could it mean made better of course you know thats part of the game and part of the reason why were talking about you know the state of the game is because like of course it can always evolve right and you know he im reading through this through this whole thread and there were a lot of things on here that i thought were interesting and ill bring some of them up but some of them are just like very like literally very nitpicky like one wait wait wait wait hold on hold on hold on hold on on reddit on reddit yeah on what is already know on one of their quality of life changes they said something like this one i agree with colorcoded teammate traps like for caustic okay i can understand that there was no like that was like see it through a wall or something maybe there is another one that said limit the amount of times a down teammate can ping i was like no i dont agree with that at all well sometimes i can be annoying when someones like yeah so i can i can understand that you know to a certain extent plus its like theyre almost more useful when theyre down yeah there was one in new feature section that he added that crate drops after level that could be something good what do you mean crate i imagine i imagine fixing either getting crate drop i mean i dont know this is from reddit im just really im just reading whats on here maybe he means apex packs because i know they get super scarce once youre once youre in the app thats what i kind of assumed maybe thats what it means okay but theres things also like rework mirages ultimate and passive i mean i could see reworking his all you were already yeah we were already kind of talking about that personally yeah so i mean theres theres something there custom products and i thought that big yes yeah see see now the ones i could agree with is like the custom servers would be awesome i mean we have a we have a community on discord itd be awesome just a jump in with you guys and have some fun you know another one leaderboards i dont personally care because im going to be at the bottom anyways you know but it like theres certain things that come with the leaderboard its not just a my number one in the world its also how many wins total do i have how many kills total do i have and thats something that like i could see what they were trying to do as far as like oh heres all your wins with gibraltar heres all your wins with bangalore but i want to know how many wins total i have i dont want to own one i dont want to know how many with that character because me personally and i think theres probably a lot of you out there but me personally i kind of switch it around part of that is because of the battle pass and how it gives you bonuses for playing as different characters but then part of that also is is it depends on like who is on my team what they are i never choose a character because i want to pay is that character i choose a character based on the team dynamic i didnt and i try to i try to mix it up to because i dont want to get too comfortable because then its like you know you always want to stay on your feet or whatever which i really saw it because i played a lot of lifeline recently because no ones getting lifeline and i really enjoy playing his lifeline and thats i was pathfinder race main for the longest time and now now lifelines in there because i just enjoy the gameplay that i have with her right and so yeah so then back to my point is like you know thats the game they wanted to create they wanted to create a game where youre maybe switching around you can have fun with any legend it doesnt have to be one however a global win a global kill count is something i feel like anybody and everybody wants you know they want to know because even even if were just having fun with the game for what it is we still want to know how were progressing you know what i mean and yeah sure how many kills were getting with wraith is fine but then if we switch over to another character it d incentivizes us to switch to that character when we see the kills are a fraction of what we have with the wraith right i agree ive always enjoyed and shooters being able to look at my full combat record and see what my full stats are instead of like individual as which i see why theyre doing that at the same time like universalize it like make it a little bit easier yeah just more you know i think myth is probably the one that summed it up best if we dont need a new gun every other week you know which is something that fortnight did i want to say at least once a month they had a new gun and then once a month they had a new item so the flow of items seemed really or the flow of new content seemed really good but they always mixed it up one time it was a gun the next time it was an item the next time it was you know something and building you know they always rotate it and so thats kind of our problem right now is that maybe what theyre trying to focus on is getting big patches when honestly little patches are just fine size doesnt matter mmmhmm thats insane tells me i dont believe her because she looks away when she says it yeah if they look away to the left or right there always lying so guys be be careful about that all right so you guys let us know what youre thinking you can go to at apex legends cast on twitter or apex legends hub cast at gmailcom you can let us know lets move on to our deep die hey guys let me tell you about a bitesized podcast if youre an avid gamer then the lore party of video game podcast is the show for you with more than episodes covering over different games and franchises the rotating hosts focus entirely on the storys characters in universe of their favorite games listeners can expect to hear topics ranging from lgbtq representation in mass effect series secret pokémon wars and the source of handsome jacks insanity in the borderlands games you can join the conversation by following the lore party of video game podcast on spotify alright this weeks deep dive were going to be covering octane our newest character in apex legends now again all this information is going to come from pro game guides so go ahead and give them a click now this ones going to be a little bit interesting because along with the release of the character respawn also released his story which im going to read for you because i think its very cool and very interesting because it directly ties this character and the game to titanfall you know we already know this is in the titanfall universe but its also just kind a pretty funny story so octane hes going to be the adrenaline junkie now the story of octane is one day octavio silva was bored in fact he was bored most days are to the preoccupied ceos of silver pharmaceuticals and wanting for nothing and wanting for nothing in life he entertained himself by performing deathdefying stunts and posting hollow vids of them for his fans to gawk over so this day he decided to set the course record for a nearby gauntlet by launching himself across the finish line using a grenade and again gauntlet from titanfall if you guys havent played it or its been a while since you play the campaign as he lay in triage hours later the doctors informed him that the damage done to his legs meant his daredevil days were over that didnt sit well with octavio who turned to an old friend for help aj chi who he guilted into forging in order to replace his legs with bionic ones suddenly able to repair his limbs at a moments notice octavio decided petty online stunts werent enough the ultimate adrenaline rush the apex games was his calling now hes hoping to become an apex champion doing the most incredible deathdefying moves anyones ever seen maybe in the arena he wont be so bored so yeah that was a story of octane i wanted to read that for you guys because i think its really funny the fact of the reason why he has these robot legs is because he tried to get the record time by launching himself over the gauntlet with a grenade all right so for octanes passive ability thats going to be his swift mend while not taking damage octane restores one health every two seconds now in general this is an okay passive ability but what its a direct correlation to is going to his tactical now his tactical is going to be his stem now with the stem you move faster for six seconds costs health to use but while its active octane is affected less by attacks that cause slow down gives you two second recharge as well so with the stem of course youre going to move about faster which is going to help you get from point a to point b and well cover that more here in a little bit on the tips and tricks but again his passive ability is going to be a direct effect of his tactical so since it takes away health using the stem when youre not in action youre going to regain that health back automatically so its going to be a slow charge but you wont have to use a health kit every time you have to use the tactical now for his ultimate ability thats going to be the launch pad with the launch pad youll deploy jump pad that catapults players through the air takes seconds to recharge now it doesnt launch you as far as you think its more for when youre already engaging with an enemy and you need to get height on them or escape now the biggest problem with this is that anyone can use this so if in fact you are being chased they will be following right behind you so very similar to wraiths ultimate ability with her with her port anyone can go through them so if you try to make an escape with the launchpad just make sure youre looking behind you because someones probably using that to get to where youre going as well overall great abilities on octane i remember when we first were covering him we were a little skeptical especially with his launch pad but so far in gameplay its a very fun character to play as you know theres nothing really theres not anything really thats being dramatically different from the other characters but this character is definitely for or you speed demons especially you guys who used stem a lot in titanfall this is definitely going to be your character now for some tips and tricks for octane there are a few hes a newer characters so were steadily growing our knowledge of octane and how to use has different abilities but heres just a few just to give you kind of a frame of reference now with the stem use it pretty frequently its got a very short cooldown rate and youll end up recovering your health through your passive ability like i said earlier this also goes for when youre traveling around or are running in and out of battle so stem variety of uses for it use it if you need to make up ground like if youre caught in the circle and youre caught outside the circle make sure you use that stem to get you faster to where you need to be or if your teammates just up and left you youre playing with a bunch of randos use that stem to help get you from point a to point b now the problem with octane as a character is he and a couple other legends are definitely the type that you could categorize as being better in a solo instance so if youre not playing as an octane if youre playing with a bunch of randos and someones playing as an octane make sure you watch what doing because with octane his speed ability that that random can very easily just get away from you and your team and go do his own thing and you wouldnt be none the wiser so with octane just be sure if youre not playing as him if someone elses just see what theyre doing if youre the type thats going to get on the mic and be like hey we need help just make sure youre managing that now while youre under the influence of stem it looks like one of your hands is occupied so you might not be able to aim down the sights this isnt the case though you can a same as normal if youre using the stem now of course you just have a needle thats coming out of your chest right there but its just a visual thing now for the launchpad ability its good for surprising enemies by quickly dropping it and jumping over them or on top of a hardtoreach area now using this its going to be faster than climbing over a wall so you can definitely get the jump on someone thats waiting for you on the other side in and waiting for you to climb you can easily get up there a lot faster with the launch pad and just give them a better form of surprise and bring down our on them now something to also keep in mind and if this is out of date i apologize but there was a recent thing with gibraltar shield were character players were beginning to realize you can stick things to it the launchpad being one of them so thats definitely something if you are playing with the team thats got an octane and a gibraltar try throwing that jump pad on to gibraltar shield and help push you farther than where you need to be theres a lot of really really good uses for the launch pad especially if youre the type thats really into trick shots quick scoping things like that theres a whole litany of things that you can do with this shield now this isnt necessarily a tip but its definitely something thats entertaining to say the least so with the other characters if you need to run faster obviously whole triangle or hold y or on the keyboard press the corresponding button to tuck away your weapon so you can run faster now with octane if you do that with him what hell do is hell hold up hand like its a finger gun and just run and its a very funny thing to see especially if youre youre the character because its just kind of a funny amusement thing in the middle of a battle but also if you are playing with someone whos an octane watch how they run because its very fun like it always gives me a chuckle anytime im playing with someone whos octane i just ill just watch them run because just the the the animation is just its just its just incredibly funny i dont know if thats because of his pneumatic legs or what its just its very fun to watch other than that like i said octane is definitely the character to play as if you were the speed demon type person someone whos always needed to get from point a to point b and just looking for a rush in the middle of the game you cant look any farther than octane all right so thats everything youre going to want to know to be a good octane main all right and we have just a quick update on something i mean i guess this could technically be coaching champions but was a quick update and that is two weeks ago now right two weeks ago now we had a we had a coaching champions where we talked about the ammos and the different special abilities each one of those hat and apparently according to a respawn developer that is completely fabricated all right i want to thank colton for bringing this to my attention because i did not see the specific tweets that he was talking about and thank you for bringing up in a really nice way so yeah apparently light ammo doesnt shred through shields like we thought we did heavy ammo doesnt slow down well actually the quote was that all ammo slows down people and energy does not have as big of a drop or whatever but its not really like a special ability it seems like so the main ones were definitely the light ammo in the heavy ammo because you know we thought they shred through them and personally i got it from youtube video now that i found out its not true im almost kind of glad i forgot to leave in the leave in the description the because that particular week we had a description for the the aim training where you know youre training yourself to aim better whatever we put the wed put the you know the thing in for that but i totally forgot to put in the thing for the other side the other youtube video but now that its not right its like oh wow well you know i dont know if this guys guy was malicious in any way or whatever but you know it does seem kind of like well dang it you know any happen i can see where people were coming from just because most weapons that are going to be using live ammo are the very fast either submachine guns or assault rifles sure i can see how someone could extrapolate that it shreds mo because youre firing at a fast at a higher rate right ill partner obviously a lmg but i think interesting that i think the whole thing with the energy ammo is is just a physics thing you know laser yeah ammunition energy ammunition it doesnt have an actual physical bullet thats coming out of it so its straight energy coming out so obviously thats not going to have a drop a drop rate or a high drop rate enough drop rate compared to the other guns yeah that ones still kind of true but the other ones definitely i could see where people could gather that just based on physics and firing rate but yeah apparently from respawn thats thats thats a technical foul yeah it was something i wanted to bring up because you know we reported on it and you know we poured it on it as fact or whatever i thought it was fact when i saw the video i was like oh well yeah that makes sense okay cool cool cool cool and then i was like so excited and we even talked about loadouts on the next hop up and how like my loadouts have completely changed my look on life is just so much better now and so yeah like apparently its not true and its just like whoa well i was i was bamboozled bamboozled okay so after we finished recording jason schreier tweeted out something that we thought was very pertinent something that we wanted to add into the show because it directly talks about what we covered in our topic of the week so im going to read this tweet from you go ahead and give him a like on twitter go look up jason schreier so you can give him that like but he tweets out a response from respawn in terms of talking about the frequency of content coming out and things like that so from respond they say we know that in addition to addressing issues with the game everyone is hungry for us to add new content the studio culture that we worked hard to cultivate and the health of our team are very important we take those things into account when we discuss our content roadmap the production schedule and the frequency in which we can update the game our longterm goal is to ensure apex legends always feels alive and thriving with a focus on quality of content over novelty or speed of release at the same time we want to maintain our culture as a development team and avoid crunch that can quickly lead to burnout or worse so thats great for a developer to say its awesome that respond came out and said this and hopefully thatll calm down a lot of people in terms of why arent you putting out this content well theyre telling you why theyre telling you they dont want to overwork their staff that they want to appease you guys as much as they possibly can but also they want to make sure that the people that they have to create the games that you love arent going to get burned out are going to be able to see their families and are going to just do what they can to better their health so thats great for respond to say and we wanted to just add this into the show because we think its very important when developers come out and say things like this especially for response so go respawn all right and theres just one more thing that we wanted to bring up there is going to be a slight restructuring of the show now that we are officially done with all the champions weve pretty much gone through all the rankings ranking our zones ranking our weapons ranking you know characters now that weve kind of gotten through all that we wanted to kind of restructure and so now our weekly show is going to turn into a biweekly show and this is just going to be so that no we dont run this into the ground we still want to make content for you guys we still want to be there for you guys but were going to start doing it on a biweekly basis idealistically what well try to do is have at least try to give you something at least once a week so one week you have a hop up one week you have a hub cast because with the hop up we can still be very conversational and hopefully get more guests on and be able just to kind of have a good conversation right whereas you know with hub cast were trying to give you all the information we can give you deep dives and things like that so with us covering all of our deep dives now with all of the other characters like nick was saying you know were basically need to figure something else out you know yeah to to make sure we can still give you the content that we want and the content that you guys you know deserve to have so from now on typically youll have a hop up one week and a hub cast the next thats the form so we are still technically weekly i guess that was probably misleading of me we are still technically weekly its just that the hub cast proper will be biweekly and the hop cop up cast will be biweekly so now instead of having to a week youre only going to have the one and now ill probably just be better in general for you know content creating yeah so we wanted to give you guys a heads up you know so youre not freaking out like hey wheres this episode and you know you know trying to figure out whats going on so we wanted to we wanted you guys to hear from the horses mouth that hey you know were working on things trying to get some more stuff together weather and see what all we can provide for you guys definitely so i think thats going to be it for us today thank you guys so much for joining us if you want to write in you can write into us at apex legends hub cast at gmailcom or apex legends cast on twitter if you like what you heard about the nerd radio were really excited about that the episodes are going to be in june so let us know what you think about it you know let us know any ideas you have any kind of feedback you have let us know in our comments or anything discord obviously will always be in the description or on the top tweet on twitter alright guys so i was your host nick and i was your host nate and well see you down in kings canyon where its gonna be legend\n"
