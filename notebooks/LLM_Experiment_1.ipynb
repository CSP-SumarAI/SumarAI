      "So like that side of my family, there's always been like this western cousins and stuff like doing pro rodeo. But then on the other hand, I had older brothers that are total punk rockers with like a half we had like a half pipe in the backyard. So I grew up in this weird thing where to me, those two worlds were always just kind of normal. Whenever I need music gear, I always go to Sweetwater.com. It its mics headphones or studio and recording gear. Sweet water has you covered Next time you need any music gear, support the podcast by using the link in the description and comment section below. It's always fascinating to me how you hear when you casually find a band and was like, how do you do, love? And then I reheard spirit world from a mutual friend. Mike Gitter. You got to check out this band called Spirit World and they combine thrash, death metal and Western. I was like, oh, I just heard them and saw the artwork like a few months prior. I think Death Western just dropped and I just randomly saw it. And I don't even know how you do that when you just randomly see a banner or come across an mean. First off, the band name Spirit World is perfect. It's sick. Love it. That's the hardest thing when you combine two words, simple words, and then you just combine them. Those tend to stick a lot. Yeah. And it's important to me trying to do this project because I ripped that straight from Young Guns. Yeah, I had that idea. And so on our demo, the original pressing of it, it starts with a sample from Young Guns where it's like, Why aren't they killing us? It's when they're like, tripping on Peyote going through this Indian village and they're like, Why aren't they killing us? We're in the spirit world, asshole. They can't see us. Really? Yeah. I don't know, I just ran with the whole Western thing. I kind of had that thought out before, so of course it's funny now. Like couple, you know, two, three years in, especially with the artwork, and now that we're touring more, I get a lot of people that are just like the combination of thrash and Western and horror and all this, that's the thing that I think separates a band the most. And that was the hardest idea to come up with. You know what I mean? To get excited to do a project. When I put all that together, the most thought went into the aesthetic and how do I build some sort of world? It looks, sounds at the whole thing. You could tell it's very well thought out. And for you, I assume it goes very deep, like your bloodline and your lineage. Like, your parents came from Texas and then moved to Nevada. I'm not sure how close they moved to Vegas. Yeah, on my mom's side, that's like the cowboy side of my family. They came up from Texas and it was probably in the so a couple of hours north of Las Vegas. They had a ranch out there that they were cattle and it was just a working cowboy ranch as my mom grew up. So when my grandfather passed away, she was left that and they sold it. Then she met my dad and kind of like mid 60s moved to Vegas, but for a big chunk of time she grew up walking to a little schoolhouse like Prairie Land shit, like total just hillbilly. So like that side of my family there's always been this know, cousins and stuff like doing pro rodeo. But then on the other hand, I had older brothers that are total punk rockers with like a half we had like a half pipe in the backyard. So I grew up in this weird thing where to me, those two worlds were always just kind of know it's. Like you get in the car with mom listening to Johnny Cash and George Jones and then if my older brother gets in, it's like misfits social d slayer. And so being like little you don't know what any of that is. And then as I got super into punk rock and hardcore and stuff and then you realize how weird that is to grow up in a family where it's like those are like the two things I was most excited about musically, like country and super underground shit. Yeah. It's crazy how that just subconsciously just kind of stuck with you. Yeah, it's weird. And you have that it's kind of like the push and pull because at one point I definitely got way away from reading westerns and kind of getting just wasn't as excited about that stuff. And then ten years goes by and you revisit it and you're even more excited. And country music too. I've never liked stuff like the pop country stuff, but like the old honky tonk outlaw country. And then I was lucky enough I caught that wave of alt country bands. So I followed that as closely, still do as I do, like thrash and death metal. So it's like having a band where I can subtly combine all the things I like in a way that still fits in with the heavy metal hardcore thrash scene is pretty cool. It sounds like you discovered it because you're printing out demos and singles from 2017 to you have the demo Viper, Blood, Spirit World and then you drop your first record, Pagan Rhythms, and that's obviously a massive jump. Yeah. So were you revisiting these memories from your childhood around there? I think what it was was I just decided I wanted to make a record. Not really being a band that was functional with bandmates and touring, sure. But I had this idea of like, I want to put a lot of energy into making a really good record and I was going to do more of like a punk rock country thing like the demo. And I had a bunch of it written. But as I started learning how to demo and track shit, started building out a little studio as soon as I could. I had Easy Drummer. Easy Drummer, too. And I started going through the loops. And then I'm like buying packs. And I got Matt from Hate Breed, put out like a drum loop pack. Oh, the fucking drum loop packs, dude, those are incredible. I wasn't good at doing the medi, but then I got like a drum loop pat from him. He had one? Yeah. And it had like a couple simple breakdowns that I could just steal. So he had like basically that was it. So then I'm like playing a guitar and all I'm playing is heavy ass shit. And so I just 180, took a Uturn, wrote Pagan Rhythms super hard, just all death metal, thrash hardcore and whatever. And now it's grown into its own thing. We're about to go tour with Sepultura. I saw that in the summer. Like the Europe festival run we got going is just like, wow. Yeah. And it's only been a couple of like it's funny how an idea like just change your mind, do something, put everything into it, and it bears fruit pretty quick. Yeah. I mean, it just looks like you put a lot of time into it. A lot from your first record, like 2001. And then less than two years later you have Death Western. And then obviously you're doing all these tours and you're already in Europe with Obituary and Agnostic Front and you have all these tours. And now you're touring with Sepatora and Creator. That's in June, right? Yeah, that's like a May June, like full us. Crazy death Angels on it too. Oh yeah. Sick, dude. Holy shit, dude. Isn't that crazy how you just make a simple decision and then the course of your life just changes? Yeah, because I was going to do it as a studio project and I was like, I'm going to write a couple of heavy records, some country, some punk rock, just do whatever I want with no not even getting into the industry stuff. The idea was just to make the records, put them out, and then maybe I would just go do some festival runs if it took off. And the next thing you know, it's like, I got to get the band together. It's like we're going on tour with Obituary. We played our first show like it's been just over a year. And in that time, that's it, man. Are you serious? Yeah. We played a couple off the demo stuff where we didn't play any heavy stuff because I hadn't written any of the metal yet a couple years ago. But our third show ever was like a year ago. So playing the metal stuff, like we learned the set decibel brought us out for the La Decibel Metal and Beer Fest. Yeah. And it was like Converge doing Jane Doe One night. So that was show number one. It's just like, okay. And then a month or six weeks after that, we're on the road with obituary, just like, let's go. Yeah, it seems like it is kind of, like, built up naturally. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you didn't even like, there was no pretense at first to have the sound, and then when the sound was developing, it just kind of, all right, this is it. Yeah, it still is to an extent. Like, I'm writing the third record right now and I finally know exactly what it's going to sound like. I haven't, like, because my older bands and stuff, like getting in a room with all your best friends trying to write riffs, I just was so tired of that approach. For good reasons, I'm sure. Yeah. I mean, it's great. The energy of that is fantastic. It's fun. But when you leave that room and you have a great riff, then you come back the next day and it just isn't the same. And then I hate that. So I like to just write, get the ideas, do it all. So write the drums, write the guitars, write all the vocals. And then the next record I'm doing, I'm combining more crazy influences into it where it's just going to be like, I feel like this is probably the idea that I should have had on the first one. But you need to write the songs, play the shows tour before you kind of understand where you're headed. Of course. So I feel like this new one I'm working on, I want to have it written before we leave for Sepultura and get it so I can get in the studio and be, whoa. Everybody takes several years to do records, but I'm on the other tip. Like, I'm pretty inspired. I'm trying to knock shit out of the park. Yeah. And I mean, for you, you are the main songwriter. All of it, like 95% plus you locking yourself in the room because it seems like to do all this music, I mean, you're already working on a third record. You're a very prolific dude. Yeah, I had a gap where I still played guitar and did a lot of stuff. I was writing songs, but I didn't share anything. And so I kind of feel a little bit of pressure of like, now I'm like, I got Century Media behind us. We're giving them three records, so I'm like, it's going to be on them to pump the brakes. Like, they're going to get a record turned in and then they have in the contract however long to turn it in. So if they want to wait, they're going to have it, you know what I mean? So if they want to push the release, I'm going to try and have it done, I'd like to get it out. Summer 2024. Be like, that's it. I like trilogies, man. Trilogies are like horror movies, western. So I'm going to do these three metal records. Like, get it while it getting is good. Yeah, especially and you got to take advantage of when you're inspired, you got to take advantage of it, dude. And I got, like, my budy Sam Pura that engineers and produces our records. Me and him work really close together on this stuff, so we both have the idea for the next record. So it's like, I want to get it while it's hot. Oh, my goodness. Dude, I had a question. Like, the record has been out for a few months. How you been feeling? Well, it seems like well, you're just bragging more. Well, I don't know, man. I listen, and I'm so involved in it, by the time it comes out, I can't really listen to it anymore. And when I do, I'm like, I just hear the things that I nitpick, of course. And so it's cool that everybody likes it, and it's getting a great response. So I'm like, okay, cool. But the honest answer is, like, I'm over that shit. I'm not the kind of guy that listens back. I don't listen to pagan rhythms anymore. Once I finally get them in the can, it's like I want to write the next thing that shits all over those records. So I'm kind of never happy with whatever I just did. It's great, but I'm trying to do the that's the way it is, man. Yeah. It's that blessing. It's like a curse. Like, you're always hungry. Yeah, and it's the creative thing is the best part. I like when you just come up with the cool, whether it's a riff or a melody, whatever that is. That's my favorite part of all this. When it's like 1 second, you're playing guitar, nothing comes out, and you're just like, I fucking suck. Why do I even bother? There's nothing. And then the next day, something. Yeah. I don't know how it happens exactly. Sometimes the guitar like, I have a Telecaster. I do most of my writing on. Not a very metal guitar, but it just feels like, great. That's one thing I loved when I started doing research. I'm like, place a Fender telly before the research. I like listening to a discography just going so I went right when I heard the first demo. You just know that's the Fender Telecaster. Yeah. Then the second one, and then the other single. Did you use that same telly for pagan rhythms? No, on that. All of that. Because on the demos, it was written with the telly, and I did the demos of pagan Rhythms, but then when we tracked it for real, that was all with a gym root. It was a fender. He has that god, I don't know what it is. Like, flat black, like heavier than fuck. It's just like you could break down doors with that thing. He's either like the strat or the jazz master. It was a jazz master. Sam Pura has one. I think when he was doing the Hundredth record or something, they had a Fender deal. So he got the artist price or some shit. Great. So I touched that thing and was like, oh, that's the rhythm tone right there. And then I think it was he's got a couple of guitars. We usually use his stuff when we record just because they're set up and good to go. And he's an EverTune guy, which I hate. And so part of the recording thing, the give and take, I like really clear pop productions and his work with stories so far and hundredth and bands in his discography where I listen back and I'm like, oh my god, it's so clean and punchy and big. I want to do that but with thrash. And so part of that is like me, even though I hate using the EverTunes, like quad tracking meticulously, doing it piece by piece. And I'm like, it takes all the fun out of recording. But I'm getting closer to that guitar tone on a record that's in my head. Yeah, that journey is still like, I think I'm going to hit it on the next record. I'm sure everybody says that. But it's like in your head and you try to get it on the fucking record. It's like, why isn't it sounding like it sounds in my head? And then that makes you go to the next record and so on and so on. Yeah, and I like that too. Like the recording and the creating part is by far my favorite. Like playing shows is fun. It's exciting or whatever and makes you feel good. But the fun part is dialing in the guitar tone and you're like, I did it, but then I listened to it too much. And then now I listen. Yeah, exactly. Now I listen to Death Western. I'm like, fucking guitar tone sucks. Like, god damn it. Next one. The next one. How did you come up with the album titled Death Western? I was going to it's a great title, man. Yeah, and it fit into it. So it was a song title when I was writing the record. So I had it. It was just going to be a song. And I think Getter asked me on like a conference call or something. It was like Century Media and some management folks. But somebody was asking me somehow Getter jumped on it and it was like they pumped it as like they played Death Western. But that came about because I had the song title and I was like, this is a badass song title. I don't have a riff or anything yet, but this is a cool oh, wow. And then on a conference call when they were asking me like, well, what should we say? The type of music is with you blending this? I'm like, well, I like this song titled Death Western. That could be, like, the next album title, actually. And they're like, oh, that's perfect. And so then it kind of morphed into them marketing and doing their thing. Yeah. So I get people asking me, like, you're creating a new genre. I'm like, Pump the brakes, playboy. I'm just like, is what it is. But like, that Death Western title just I don't know where it came from. Just mix and death metal and it's you though western, it's simple, but it's kind of catchy enough where it's perfect, dude, coming out with those simple two words and put them together, that's the hardest thing to do. I consciously do it all the time. It's so hard to do, man. And you got it. Yeah. And it's hard to when it happens, you always feel way smarter. But the truth is it's a total accident. It's always an accident, dude. Like, Spirit World, Death Western and all these things fit so well together. But I couldn't do it again if somebody was like, dude, you're a genius at branding and marketing. Help me. I'd be like, I can't help you. I don't even know how I'm doing it. It's just dumb luck. And I don't know. Do you think there's like, a parallel with you being disciplined and hard work that those ideas just kind of fall out of the sky? I think so. I spend so much more time focusing on this stuff and the work aspect of it than an incredible amount of time. So to me, I feel like I work really hard and I get very little great riffs, great ideas, great visuals, but I get just enough that we need. I got an album title, I got a cool look for the band. So it's like, you only need half a dozen of these kind of great ideas. But for the time spent, it's like, I don't do it quick, I can tell you that. It takes me a long time of there's a lot of shitty, of course, song titles, so, yeah, I would say 100%. It's all just the maniacal amount of work that goes into trying to mine for gold. That's it. And then you get the one keeper. Yeah. It's like you're mining for gold without trying. Yeah. Then you just happen this one nugget of gold hits your mind. I don't know where like, what the heck did I come from? Or yeah, you've been mining for fucking five years. Yeah, that's the other thing, too, is a lot of people ask me when I'm writing because the blend of we don't do clean singing or anything, but we don't sound like everybody else, but we do have, like I guess we mix a few different underground genres that people don't typically mix the way that we do. And I'm just like, that's just the shit. I like, number one. I'm just a fan. So trying to write a record that I will truly love is the goal. And then I love old obituary like Slayer. But I also grew up through that golden age of hardcore where shit like Hate Breed Strife, like that Stompy era, I love that stuff. And so combining all those things to me is just easy because that's the stuff I like. Yeah, it seems like you never compromise your vision at any point. Well, when you cut out all the that's why I don't like getting in a room and writing or any of that stuff because I just want to do what I want to do. As selfish as that sounds. It's like sometimes you got to do it, man. Yeah, I'm doing it. For me, at the end of the day, I didn't plan on doing a whole lot with this band. And it just so happens that all these opportunities pop up that I'm taking advantage of. But it's like, I would still be making these records with or without Century Meter, anybody, you know what I mean? Which sounds weird to because some people need to tour or get that kind of fanfare or something out of it money or get a business. But I really like records, man. Like you said, when you stumble on a band that you like, I do that every week. I just am constantly looking for finding like, I need that new song, that new band, and that's just a part of my life for so long. I don't know. So I try and make that band. I try and be that band. Yeah, I want to be the band that if I found, I would literally just have to call my brothers, my best friends and be like, holy shit, dude, this is the band. You know what I mean? Like, when you're young and you feel that passionate about music, yeah, it's cool. It doesn't happen as much anymore. It's rare when a band really kicks my teeth in where I'm just like, Holy fuck. But that's kind of the goal, too, is like, I want to be that band for somebody else. Yeah, we're very similar in that way where just try to create your own favorite band. Yeah, it sounds simple, but it's not. Yeah, it sounds, you know, stupid, but yeah, when you actually try to do your oh, man, try to try to get that sound out of your know, it's tough. Yeah. And I was just listening to a lot like I said, I heard the pod with Dino on it. But I've been going back listening to Fear Factory quite a bit over the last year. I remember being in high school, they toured with Slayer and all my friends went to this show in Boise and came back and were just like, fair Factory fucking blew Slayer off the stage. And I was just like, Go fuck yourself. No way. And for whatever. When you're young and you just can't really get into something. I just could not really truly love Fear Factory until later. And now I keep going back to their first three records, and I'm just like, fucking incredible. God, what a fucking band. Over and over. I don't know. So I think I do that too, where it's like, you go back to things that 20 years ago, people were telling me, this is the best. This is the band. And I was too stupid or obtuse, whatever to hear it then. And then you it's cool to go back. I'm like oh, wow. Why did I not love this back then? Yeah, and I think as you grow up, too, you just stop ever hating on anything because, you know, like, maybe I can't hear it now, but I know myself in ten years, this could be my favorite record. So that's generally what I say. If someone tries to turn me on to something, I'd be like, Cool. I can't hear it right now, but maybe I'm open at some point. This could be my shit. Yeah, I remember in high school, everyone was jamming Dystopia, and I just didn't get it back then. But now it's like, I turned in my 30s love Dystopia, obsessed with Dystopia. It's so weird how your taste can change and evolve. Yeah, and I think it's cool, too, if you're open to it. That's where when you're young and you shut yourself off because you're only into these little narrow things. Yeah, it's nice to I just like finding new shit. That's the main thing. I like making new songs. I don't want to listen to the last song I did. I want to make the new one. I want to find the new band. Yeah. I don't know. It's that hunt. It's like the collector syndrome, you know? Not a lot of people have that. Like, that just constant hunger or just constantly hunting for new bands. It's a special person, man. If you look at a lot of your friends, not everyone has that hunger. No. And I don't know, I think I've always just been like that. I don't know. It's fun. It is. It's nice. And it's that little joy you get when you find something cool. Yeah, I've been listening to a lot of, like there's a lot of the new kind of American skinhead bands going, that just Oi stuff that I love. Oi. But you go through phases where I've heard every fucking band. You can only listen to Cox Bar so many times, but then there's all this new stuff popping off, like Liberty and justice and all these cool bands all over the US. So I've been, like the last few months just jamming the shit out of that too. I don't know, man. Yeah, and then you go through phases. Is this the band you're talking about? Yeah, I love Cox Bar. That's like I mean, it's a sick band name, literally. Shock troops is one of the best albums of all time. No doubt. What's it called? Shock troops, man. Right there. Oh, wow. That's like first wave punk rock, late 70s, late 70s. They don't get the cred in the US that they should. But I mean, front to back classic. Ten out of ten. Where are they from? They're from England somewhere. Why is there a lot of great punk rock come out of England? I don't know. Hard to say, man. A lot of good stuff. But there's a bunch of cool new bands. Liberty and justice out of Houston. Conservative military image, I think, like, out of Chicago, they were newer. Yeah. Slugger, I think, is out here. Slugger sick. Fucking badass, dude. Slugger's tight, man. I don't know if you guys are like, whoever listens. This pod, this is a heavy pod, but this is like I listen to a lot of stuff, man. I love punk rock, love street punk, Oi, all that stuff. There's a lot of versions of heavy, man, to always start the punk, the metal, the thrash, anything underground, too, like whether it's death core, death metal, thrash, black metal, like all that stuff. I don't know. I pull from all of it. I dig it. It makes sense when I listen to what Spirit World, you just throw everything in there. I do. And that's what I mean. On the new record, I found another way to blend some more of this stuff. So I'm going to bring in some more of the four on the floor. Catchy punk rock. Where the bridge? You bring it into more of a sing along thing because I haven't been doing that. I've been doing a lot of just like, fuck you. Here's, like the eight hardest riffs I wrote the last month. How do I put them together and just beat your head in? So now I'm going to do some more, kind of bring some other stuff into it that explains you being so hungry. And it's finding new bands and going back to older bands. Spirit World has this thing where only a few bands have only a few of them, where you could kind of play any show. You could go play with Agnostic front. Then you could play with Obituary. Today you're going to play with, like, a Death Corps band with Sulfur. Only a few bands can do that. Yeah. And the cool thing is we don't fit in with anybody because we come out in, like, rhinestone suits looking like a honky tonk band. And so when we were on tour with Agnostic Front, we're playing in Berlin and there's people that have been watching Agnostic Front for 30 years, that when we walk out, the vibe is, fuck this band. They're just looking at us like, what is this garbage? These dudes have cowboy hats on. And then halfway through the set, you just see them break down and they just can't help head banging a. Little bit. Wow. And then afterwards they come up, buy a record, and it's like having that being a little fearless too. It takes a little confidence to walk out into a room to a bunch of traditional skins and punk rock dudes and then play thrash metal in rhinestone suits. But if you can get over the hump of not giving a fuck what anyone thinks because, you know, the set is really good, you can win people over, man. And that's how you fit in. At least for me, it's like, have a crazy idea and then don't be afraid to put yourself out there. I don't care if it's we played with, like, Mind Force and Drain. That was our last show. Like, huge new school hardcore show. Yeah. So you play that and when we play, all the lights cut off and it's like we put on a show. So it's a totally different vibe than every other band. And then our next big tour will be with Sepultura, where it's like old school thrash legends, three of them, and then us. So I think it's important to try and who wants to be in a box, you know what I mean? I want to be able to play with all my favorite bands and I have such eclectic taste. I couldn't imagine doing it any other way. You got to be able to. Yeah. So when you're playing with Agnostic Front, like, you're talking, like, old school hardcore and you're wearing what you're you can you see the reaction in their faces. Yeah. No one had ever heard of us because that was our second time to Europe. And like I said, we've only been playing shows for a year. So we went over and did Bloodstock and did a handful of shows in August. And then we did a US tour with Creeping Death and 200 Stab Wounds, which that one that's the new school new wave of old school American death metal thing going on, which is also cool. But those kids all come out of the hardcore scene to some extent, so there's a lot of crossover. And then the Agnostic Front one, yeah, it's an older crowd and they had their whole run on Epitaph, so they have a lot of people that love their melodic anthemic songs, you know what I mean? So we come out and it's just brutal heavy shit, dude. It's crazy. You're only been like your first record came out a year before this and you're already playing a European festival. Yeah, man. Crazy. You guys are fucking nuts, dude. Well, and part of it, I was in old hardcore punk bands and you just learn if you want to be successful and carve it out, you got to get to Europe. And so it's like, you can wait two years or you can go kick the door in. And so that's one thing. As much time as I spend on the writing and creating all this stuff. You got to put yourself in the best position to succeed. That's why a guy like Mike Gitter, who he's like me, he's always finding new bands. Always, dude, that's another freak. But like, a guy like like, that's my segue into getting distribution by Sony, get picked up, have them rerelease the album that I released, DIY, and then that's how we were able to get to Europe. So it's like those two things. It's like, you got to know who books the bands you love and randomly, Nick Storch hit me up because he loves Pagan Rhythms. So right then, I was like, random. I was like, that's the best guy. Like, if I could pick a booking agent, that would be the guy. And he's already showing his cards that he loves my band. So then it's like, well, shit, Nick Storch loves my band. This is going to be like you manifested without even trying. I think part of it was because I kind of knew what to do if you had it. Like, for being around and knowing a lot of people and then not having the I didn't need any of this to happen, but I was smart enough to pay attention and be like but if it was going to happen, these are the people that you connect with. And these are the things you do to go break a band, dude, you just have this natural quality. Because the question you get is it's old? How do you get a manager? Guards? How do you get, like, a booking agent? You're like, I don't know. You write a record that makes those people fucking when they hear it go, Yo. And then they call somebody and say, you hear this. It's the same thing. It's like it happened. It's not because I'm anybody's darlin. I'm not in the click. I'm nobody's like, boy. So it's like the make a record. That should be the most important thing instead of getting with your friends and putting out those five songs immediately for $1,500. It sounds like shit, and you love it. Take time, man. Make the art number one, and then it cuts through the noise. Yeah. If you're willing to put in that time the time and money. Because I recorded Pagan Rhythms. All that's out of pocket. And I mean, I spent the same amount on that that Century Media gave me for our next record. So it's like, Whoa, yeah, I'm willing to like, I believe that I can make a great record. And I knew to make a great record, you got to get in the studio. It's going to cost you, like, ten grand. What if no one buys it? It's like, Well, I'm out ten grand, but I'll be proud of a record. And no one was pushing me to do these things. There's no outside pressure. It was all just self driven. So then when I put it out, I sold out the first vinyl pressing within months. So it was like immediately, it's like, okay, the record is good. You don't need hype if the shit's good and it does it itself. You know what I mean? When the music does it itself. Yeah, the artwork and the music, I don't know. And I realized that I have a good career, and so I come from a place where I could save up money and be like, I don't need help. I can write the whole thing. I can record it. I can pay for a pressing, and if I lose out, it'll suck. But I'm willing to do it because I need to make a record. And I realize that's an incredibly blessed position to be in. Even, like, five guys sometimes can't figure out how to get three grand each to do their songs justice. Yeah, man, you just had that freaking natural something inside you. I'm always kind of like, fascinating. Where does that shit come from? I don't know. It's weird. People ask me, and I don't think it's talent. I think it's almost like a level of maybe it's like just like a love letter type thing. It's like that pride. Maybe it's like, if you're going to make a record, what's stopping you from making a record as good as your favorite indie label? Whether you're into metal or whatever, pick your favorite label. If it's $20, spin. How much do they spend on these records? Yeah, they all use the same 20 engineers. The same 20 producers. They master them. It's like nothing really truly separates you from any of that, at least in this day and age. It's true. So if you know what they're doing and you have good songs, why can't you make a record that immediately catapults your band? The answer is you can just do the work. Yeah. I mean, you put out the first record. Being independent, I just got it picked up by literally from a label from a booking agent. People just want to work with crazy let's Death Western. The COVID James Bowsema from Las Vegas. Everybody that worked on the record, all the artwork and layout, are all my friends from so, like, we went and ate tacos at El Puerto Marisco's, sat down, and I was like, here's the idea for the record I want to take, because I wrote a book of short stories that came out with pagan rhythms. It has all the characters. It's this big concept between the records and the book. So I was just, like, describing the characters I wanted. I'm like, I want a 1960s, like, horror movie poster or an old western where you take the characters and you just like so basically, I just asked him to draw me a movie poster, and then he gave me some sketches and was like, jeez, man, what coloring do you like? And he had I got to post it, but we have, like, three or four of the other colorways. And like, the sketches, they're pretty cool. But I love the orange. I'm like super bright and it doesn't look like anybody else. So I'm like, that's the one, like big ass cowboy on it. Smoking. Let's go. Sticks out. It fits the vibe, man. It fits like the record title, everything. Yeah, man. It's hard to get all those elements to align. And it's a fucking special thing when all those things is fucking this lineup. And I didn't peg him to do the record, actually getter wanted. He had this Frank Frazetta piece. And I love Frazetta. And it was like something from the 70s where it's like an Indian and a cowboy, like Tussling with the tomahawk, like in the dirt. It's pretty violent. It's a great picture. And so we talked to the Frazetta's daughters that handle his estate now and got permission to license it because they won't license stuff to just yeah. And so on one hand, I was like, my older brother that plays bass loves Frank Frazetta, Death Dealer, all this comic book shit. And so he's like, on one hand, shitting his pants. He's like, dude, you can get a fucking Frazetta. Do it. Do it. And I wanted to, but then on the other hand, I was like, yeah, but it doesn't have the characters from my book. I want to get somebody that can custom do it. And every artist I hit up was like, no, can't do it. Not for that budget. If you want an actual painting with all this custom bullshit, fuck you. I'm not the guy. And then we played with municipal waste. And the guy Tony was like, oh, yeah, check this out. And showed me the COVID of their last record. And it was my budy from Vegas did it. And I was like, Fuck. I was like, I'll fucking hit him up. And it wasn't their record. It was actually the tour art for the tour. We were yeah, he drew this minotaur with like a battle vest with all the bands on patches, just crazy shit. And I was like, well, if he can do a fucking minotaur with a bunch of heavy metal patches on it, maybe he can do my movie poster. Yeah, you really combine not only music stuff, but stuff from film. Yeah. It would have been sick to do Frazetta. I love his style. But at the same time, I do have this big I like my own stuff. Like I want to build my own mythology with my band. And it's like as cool as it would be to license that, everybody does that. You pick a great artist, you license something. It doesn't actually fit with the subject matter. You're lucky if it does somehow, some way, like conceptually. But sometimes that's random. Sure. So for me, I really wanted to have just build my own shit. That's always cooler to me. I think it is, man. You want to be a leader. Yeah, he just did the new Frozen Soul that's coming out. He did the COVID of that. I think they just released it on their new single that came out. I think yesterday really came out. Yeah. That's another band name I heard about from the famous Mike Getter. Yeah. Frozen Soul Rolls, man. What's their sound like? I never jammed them. They're like old school death metal. Like little chainsaw, but they're heavy as fuck. Yeah. And they're like all Texans, just like giant dudes. They're great, man. They fucking bring out a snow machine at some of their shows, make the lights blue. They have this whole fetish for everything. Cold, cold school death metal, baby. Oh, just my logo. Okay. We're fucking serious, dude. Yeah, that's a new serious. Yeah, James did that one, too. It's sick. Really? Whoa, what? What is going on? Want to he showed me we had lunch a couple weeks ago and he showed me all the artwork, but I'll let them reveal their yeah, that's fucking there's some cool stuff with that artwork that ties into like, the front and back. It's tight. A full on concept. Yeah, it's cool. I love that shit, man. When there's really thought put into it. Who mixed your last record? Sam Pura. He engineered mixed and then he was going to master it. And then this dude Alberto in Austin. What were we doing? I think we were trying to see if anybody could beat his master because we had a mastered version. And so we had two or three different people do a test master and this friend of Sam's, Alberto just fucking crushed it, man. Sounds great. Yeah. It reminds me of like a 90s, like, Colin Richardson mix. Exactly. That's like the reference stuff that I was showing Sam. I'm like, dude, the old the Machine Head. All these roadrunner releases that came out. Colin Richardson. Yeah. Jay. Look up. Colin Richardson. I'm curious. Like the records he did in the 90s. Fucking bolt thrower. Machine Head. Bolt thrower. Yeah. Fuck yeah. Oh, my goodness, dude. Yeah, he rules, man. And he doesn't do a lot of interviews and stuff. I wonder why he should. I don't know. There's very little stuff. But he's got some incredible albums, man. Machine Head. What record did he do? Burn my eyes, man. Burn my eyes. Okay. And I think I want to say he's definitely like in England somewhere too, man. He is in England. Yeah. He did. Cannibal corpse bloodthirst. I know that because I always kind of go on that record. When did bloodthirst come out? That's 90s, right? I don't know what year that one was. Late 90s, probably. Bloodthirst has to be ninety s ninety nine. Boom. Oh, barely got it, dude. Barely got it. Yeah. That's a fucking Colin mix, man. Classic. Yeah. I love the big when the old industry, when they had the majors and the bigger indies, when they would spend 200 grand on a record. And it's like, those are the ones that I can't get out of my head because it's like the classic Ministry albums and Fair Factory Machine Head, like Life Agony, even like Mad Ball. The bands that were coming out on roadrunner in the 90s, like the polish and the drum tones and the sounds, I'm just like, they're so fucking good, man. And it was all the tape. It was into that transition where it was still like really nice studios, huge budgets. And those are the records where I'm like, in my head, I want to sound like that but modernized. Just pick my favorite parts of those. The that's a dream, man. Make something that shits on Colin Richardson. Can you do that? Is that possible? Probably not. But that should be the it's. It's nothing like a good fucking sounding produced record. Yeah. And I love big ones. I'm not afraid of the pop sound. So if you listen to Death Western and Headphones, there's a lot of space you can hear, and it's just really punchy and dynamic. I hate the compressed a lot of records when you listen to them, it's just so compressed and you just don't have that pop. I like that big shit. Yeah, there's like a big sonic difference from the first record to your second record. Yeah. And that's like being critical, like not having the time because Pagan Rhythms, like, I paid for it and it was good, but it was also like there's a lot of things it's like, okay, out of Money, out of Time sounds good. Let's go. And then for the next one, me and Sam were like, okay, we're going to fucking hit this one out of the know. It's crazy how you could go do the same person. But it will sound the next record will sound completely different. Yeah, it always kind of blew me away just by having a couple conversations prior it's like a couple the mixing on Death Western, I've never done it like this, but we did it remote where I would log in. He has a way to do a stream. So I'm hearing the sound that's coming out of his computer in the studio. And so for like a month, dude, I would get off work when he'd get in there. We'd spend four or 5 hours a day just mixing the fuck you serious? Out of Death Western, like more time spent on that than probably any other piece of the recording thing. And it was like the last week, all that time we thought we had some good rough mixes. And then something happened in the last week where it finally just happened, where it's like, holy shit. And it just sound incredible. And if we hadn't spent that much time, it wasn't there. It sounds crazy, but all that tweaking out on it thinking it sounded good. It was like the final 1015 hours, it just came together, finally got the guitars, to sit, the drums, everything, where it was just like, boom, that's it. That sounds like a lot of agony. Horrible. That's why I can't listen to it. That's why all that time listening to it, I'm just like, one day ten years from now, I'll revisit these, and I'll probably love them, but right now, no. So you mix it remotely so you hear what he's hearing, where you're at. Yeah. And never heard of my in my life. Dude, the COVID shit, man, opened up a whole new world of doing things at my job too. I never worked remote before. I've always been, like, in construction type shit. And I moved into process management. And I have a remote job now where it's like I do a lot of the things. I don't go in for meetings. I jump on zoom. And it's crazy. Like, I'm virtual guy, and my job didn't exist a couple of years ago, and it damn sure didn't exist the way that we do it now. Same thing with mixing a record. So all these technology, like, weird things all just kind of work in my favor too. Like dumb luck, because I couldn't have went up to the studio and spent that much time. Like, no way. But being able to knock out three or four know, jump on sitting in my bed with my know, jen would come walking in from work and I'd be like, headphones on, like, listening to and be like, no, bro, the fucking Snare. It's like, the snare the snare needs to go up. And then you get the snare up, and then you lose whatever it is. That's what we did day after day. It's like, this sounds good. This sounds fucked. This sounds good. This sounds fucked. You're fired. Bounce it down. Bounce it. And that was another thing with the label where everybody has an idea of who should we have mix it, who should we have do. I just I already knew I was going to do the record with Sam, so I was a pretty bad creative partner for Getter and the label and everybody and our management. Because I love I love all the guys you're talking about. When I'm done, if you don't like the mix, then we can have somebody else take a crack at it. But I got it. Don't worry. You see, that's always the tough part, which guide me through this. At what point do you like, you listen to somebody and you know when not to listen? You got to go with your gut. When you're younger, you think everybody knows. They have this special experience, life experience, talent, and they know more than you. And I learned in my business career and in the band stuff, nobody spends as much time as I do with my stuff. Nobody. Like, I spend thousands of hours on it. And everybody else that ever comes in with an opinion, maybe they listen to the demos that I sent them to check out. Maybe they listen to them three times. I've listened to them a hundred times, and maybe they've worked with Arthur Risk. I love his productions. On, like, Power Trip, he did the new creator. There was a bunch of great guys that I would love to work with, respect their work. But me and Sam have a special connection of making records that nobody else understands. And so I just had to like, you just got to be unafraid to go with your gut. That's it. And there's no wrong answer because it's art, right? Like, you could have had five different guys mix it. But you got to believe what you're doing is special. And if something's that special to you, I really believe, would you just have somebody that's never heard your band come in at the last second to mix it? Is that special? Or is it special to have the guy that you recorded your demo, pagan rhythms, everything that's like, that's your fucking boy that's going to spend a month mixing it because it's important, and he knows how special it is for you to get this record out to me, even if we would have fucked it up like that. Experience in some ways means more than having a named guy in the metal scene. You know what I mean? So I don't know, man. It's like no one can do it for you. You just got to know when to take somebody's good idea and when to say, I got it, man. Just trust me. If I fuck it up, I'll own it. But I got this. Yet it's such a struggle, the word ego comes to mind. Is it going with your gut? Is it ego? Is it your real vision? And is the ego off when you really stick to your guns? Well, that's the thing where you fuck it up. If the record sounds really bad and you don't hit it out of the park, but you're the one that's saying, no, I got it, I got it. I'm right. Then it's probably ego. And you're probably an asshole. You probably should have listened. You probably should have listened to somebody. But it's a fine line. It's a fine line, dude. Yeah. And you got to roll the dice, too, because it's so easy to mess up records, especially mixing and engineering. Like, everybody that's ever made a record knows it's always about to just go off the cliff. It's like, damn, are we about to break up right now? It's always going, yeah. And I just think that I'm in a lucky position where I have a really close friend with a great studio that we're trying to capture the same thing. And this third record, we both have an even better idea of where we're going with it. So I think the leap from Pagan Rhythms to Death Western to the new one, when we're done, people will see it's going to be a sonic thing, you know what I mean? Which I think is cool. Not a lot of bands get to do that where you have multiple records with the same team, everybody 100% firing on all cylinders, trying to crush it. That's also a blessed place to be. Yeah. It sounds like you have this deep connection. You found someone that just shares the vision and trying and get what you have in your mind or what you're hearing out. Okay. You're trying to get this out into the speakers. Yeah, man. And the other thing I really like about Sam is we do not like the same music. He loves new metal. He's younger than me, so he's like a big new metal guy. But he loves fucking pop music and all kinds of shit that I don't listen to. Wow. So when he gets excited about an arrangement or some of the production choices and he's really geeking out over it, sometimes I don't even know what he's talking about. I can't even hear it. He's one of those guys that can hear and be like, oh, the overheads, the clarity. And there's like transient detail here. And I can't tell the difference. He's like ABN with some plug in on and I'm like, dog, cool. I'm glad you're stoked because I literally can't tell the difference of what the fuck you're talking about. But he's like got the weird he's got the geek thing, which is I don't have that. I can't listen to something and be like, oh, you need to knock out some 4K here, dog. Go ahead and notch the EQ. Like, I'm not that guy. So I have to like I don't know. You got to have a team, man. Especially like if you know you're not great at something. So there's trust there. There's trust involved from your side. Yeah. And that's a big thing, man. You just got to say I can't hear what he's talking about, but I believe he knows what he's talking about. So do it, man. That's such a fucking hard balance, dude. Yeah. Oh my yeah, because that could bomb know. That's the other thing. Yeah, we definitely had we also we are real adamant about Thomas Printon played drums on the record and he's incredible drummer. But I didn't want to have a bunch of samples on the Snare or kicks that weren't ours. So we did sample everything. But it's him on the fucking Snares. We use tune different whatever, but we just blended all of our samples. And so I've had a lot of people tell me, like, oh yeah, your drums are programmed, and just say shit like that. And I'm like, no they're not, motherfucker. This is all like literally crazy performances captured. It's just like the way you do it, man. Isn't that like I'm not saying he started doing this, but isn't that like what Colin does? Basically the performance is there. Everything's mic'd up and then you do the sound replacing. So you get the sound, but you get the different I'm big into I just geek out over production of records. And I looked at a lot of Tom Petty stuff that he did with Jeff Lynn where that production style where instead of recording the entire drummer playing the whole kit, it's like other people do it, too. Like Eric Valentine did it on the Queens of Stone Age record, the one that Dave Grohl played on, where it's like, don't play the fucking no hands. Don't play the symbols. And so they track them differently. So Dave Grohl doesn't know the songs and he's like, playing by feel. So then when they go back and try and comp the takes together, it's almost impossible. So all those little things, I geek out over records and I'm like, how the fuck did they get these drums like this? Why aren't the overheads and the symbols washy? And it's like, oh, they recorded them separate. That's why there's no, like, Tom bleed or snare or kick. It's like it's only the high hat being played. And then they got to match it know? But it's not to the so, like, all those little things is what me and, like, connect. We don't listen to the same type of music, but we listen to the same productions. And even if it's a band he doesn't like, I'll send him a shit and be like, this production right here. And then we just break it down. Like, how the fuck did they do it? Google every person that worked on the record, dude. Just geek shit, man. That explains a lot. And you'll be surprised. I've come to realize this. Not a lot of people do the Googling and finding names and the names and what studio we're at and what year. To us, it's like, well, yeah, you were just doing it. You was doing it. But a lot of people don't do that. Yeah, I love that stuff. When I hear a band, I like or a record, I like once the initial thing where I just listen to it and I'm just like, wow, this is great. Then I'm like, how'd they do it? Who wrote all the songs? Who produced it? Who engineered it? What studio did they use? Who mastered it? Exactly. Then I'm like well, who mixed it? Who mastered it? So it's like this whole thing. It's like, I look at records more like, how do you make a movie where nobody talks shit on a director for bringing in a great cinematographer, even though that guy totally shapes the tone, color, like, visual of the film. But sometimes with music, people are like, oh, you write your song, but you're bringing in a producer that I don't look at it that way. I'm like, the end result is important. And if you have to get specialized people to do it, I don't want to know the recipe. Of the meal. I just want the meal to be banging. That's the way you put it. Yeah, I take that approach, too. If we've got to do some tedious shit like quad tracking guitars, even though I fucking hate it, because you have to just it takes the fun out of it. But how else are you going to get it that clean to where the end result is in the ballpark of what I want? Yeah. So you go in into songs or record or concept where you have the vision first, it seems. Yeah. When you have the vision first and what you have in your head first and then you just try to execute. Yeah. For this new record, it's going to sound weird, but I know it's going to be a darker it's a trilogy, right? So it's like Star Wars. It's like, this is going to be like the dark cliffhanger. It's going to be a much darker record. But I also want to have, like I want to start it with some horror movie, real gothic things, rip into a couple of fast thrash songs. Then I want to do some sort of blue, grassy country stuff that's going to be kind of left field. But I'm just mapping out the record. So it's like Side A, okay, I've got Side A done, and everything has to be vinyl for me, when I think about a record, because I came up in that era where it's like, you got a Side A and a Side B. So Side B, when you flip it over, it has to fucking punch you in the mouth. Has to be good. But Side B for like, a metal band, has to be as good as Side A. You can't have any filler. Wow, I never thought about it that way. Yeah, I don't know. I guess I'm a freak. But yeah, I map out the whole record and then it's like, so what songs are actually in here? I'm like, I need three or four fast, heavy thrash songs and I've got two weird kind of countryish rockabilly things I want to do. And then I've got an outro and an intro. It can't be over, like, 35 minutes because that shit's fucking too long. Nobody can listen to a record longer than that. So it's like, carve all that out. And then on the other hand, I've got all these riffs where I'm just like looping drums, riffing, riffing, riffing. And I'm like, now take those, carve those up, where do they fit? And I can't do that if I got to explain every step to a homie and be like, here's this song. I'm going to do this. And then they have their idea. I have too many goals I have to set for each song and for the record. So it's got to be just in the trenches doing the work. You're right, man. I'm definitely a big guy. I always tell people, you got to jam in a room together in a full band. But you know what meeting people like used to it's not for everybody. Some people just work better alone. And I got a day job. It's like if I only did music where we could just hang out and play. It would be badass to just play music with people all the time just to get that other inspiration. Like that weird stuff where the drummer hits like a groove you would never think of. But also got to be realistic. I work for a living, so ain't got time. Ain't got time. Ain't got the money. So I got to do it efficiently. And time too. Yeah, when it says you which you could just do so much more. And you don't got to worry about any bullshit around you. You don't have to worry about this person. This person can wake up at noon. So I got to wait, start going. I can be really hard on myself. I'm way harder on myself than I would be to you. Like, if you showed me a cool riff. I'm a bit of a people pleaser. So I'd be like, it's cool, man. But what I really want to say is, yeah, not good enough. Your riff fucking sucks. Yeah, it could be there. If I were you, I would spend another like I would ten more hours and then come back. But I'm not going to tell somebody that because I'm always way harder on myself. But working solo, it's like I hear it and I'm like, it's not there. Fucking delete it next. Which it's a lot easier for me to self critique than it would be to build that trust and not hurt somebody's feelings or just cause a giant shit show. You know what I mean? Man, you're just putting hours in hours. Yeah, man. So much work. Cut. But I love doing it. So that's the other thing that I think separates the men from the boys. Are you inspired? Do you love what you're doing? Because that's going to come through. You can't fake that. True. And you have a trilogy of videos for Death Western. You also come up with the concept of the videos as well. So the videos, a lot of that visually the story stuff is an old friend of mine from high school that has been doing film stuff the whole time as a career. So all these sick ass videos, they kind of fit into the world. But this is all my buddy Tod and all his friends that work on a super low budget. And I tell them the basic premise, and then he's just like, what can we do? Can we burn down a church? We really wanted to burn down a church, but we couldn't get the permits to permits. Yeah, because it's a whole thing. And so all the things that you see in these videos are like we have really big crazy ideas, and it's like, how do we do it? And then it's just same thing with Sam. It's like, this is one of my super close friends that loves my band, loves the vision, and gives a shit. So it's like, our videos are going to look like they're going to look like we spent ten times more. They look incredible, dude. Yeah, man. I like film stuff too, so it's like, I don't want to be in a band that does a video where it's four guys in a dark room playing in a warehouse. To me, I'd rather curry yourself, probably. Yeah. That's not what I'm here for. I want to do a video where it's like, people watch and they're like, what is this shit? Is this a movie? So first you start with the premise, and obviously you take it to the pros and, hey, let's try this, and then try to execute. And then a bunch of our friends, everybody in these videos is just like, friends of friends that are super talented that in Vegas, we have a big showbiz. There's a lot of people that work on the so, like, we have people know are circus. Like, the actress right there is like a contortionist professionally. And so we knew she was on board. So it's like, let's make her a demon. We'll kill her and then have her come back to life. And she does all this crazy she can bend in half. So it's like, I could never come up with that. But when you know you have a world class contortionist that is one of the best in the world, that works at Cirque, it's like yeah. There you go. Oh, my goodness, dude. Yeah. I don't know, man. It's cool. Like, all that artistic stuff. It's like when you get up for ten years putting steel toes on, working construction, and then over here, the creative part, you just can't express it because you don't have an outlet. When you get the chance to do it, fucking go hard. Do it. It's your band. Everybody's got a guitar in a basement. But this is my shit. So it's like, I want to do stuff that I'm inspired. I want my video to be, like, crazy. That's accomplished. Yeah, man. It's so important how everything needs to line up. Like, the music needs to be there. Like, the vision and the videos and the artwork. You got it, dude, and you fucking did it. That's the thing that's like, when you look back at it, like, being prolific is, like, one thing, but if the stuff is good, if you never relent where you're like, every piece has to be good, then you can truly be proud of your stuff. You don't have any of that cringey shit where you're just like, we phoned it in and then excuses. No money, no time, whatever. You know, deep. Like when you phone it in and then you make excuses later. You do. And that's the stuff. Like, I learned that the hard way. One part of me is like, never again. Shit's got to be never again. Never. It's not worth it. I'd rather not do it than to phone it, know? Well, Stew Spray World's badass. Thank you, man. We should end it on a high. Uh, I appreciate you making the drive down from my Vegas. You got a sick out show tonight. Playing with a Death Corps band. My boys have sulfur, baby. You guys could play any show you want. Flyer. Holy moly, dude. You guys could play with Agnostic Front and then play the Affliction studio in Sewell Beach. Yeah. Why not, man? That's the dream, dude, not many bands can do that. It's fucking badass. Like I said, it's a blessed place to be, man. Build your band and your project. How? You don't don't get put in a box? Fuck, no. Well, Stu, where can people find you the band? Where should people go? Shit. Instagram, basically. Our guitar player is doing it for me, so Spirit World profit on Instagram. And then our web store is down for merch, but we're about to open it back up with somebody doing fulfillment. So Spiritworldprofit.com will have cool all the merch. Give it a week or two. I don't know when this comes out, but yeah, man, then we'll be on the road. Like the road, dude. That's it. Come out to a show. All right, Steve. Thank you for your time. Can't wait to do the show tonight. I'm stoked. Yeah, man. All right. One that's it. Later. Later.\n"

      "\"So like that side of my family, there's always been like this western cousins and stuff like doing pro rodeo. But then on the other hand, I had older brothers that are total punk rockers with like a half we had like a half pipe in the backyard. So I grew up in this weird thing where to me, those two worlds were always just kind of normal. Whenever I need music gear, I always go to Sweetwater.com. It its mics headphones or studio and recording gear. Sweet water has you covered Next time you need any music gear, support the podcast by using the link in the description and comment section below. It's always fascinating to me how you hear when you casually find a band and was like, how do you do, love? And then I reheard spirit world from a mutual friend. Mike Gitter. You got to check out this band called Spirit World and they combine thrash, death metal and Western. I was like, oh, I just heard them and saw the artwork like a few months prior. I think Death Western just dropped and I just randomly saw it. And I don't even know how you do that when you just randomly see a banner or come across an mean. First off, the band name Spirit World is perfect. It's sick. Love it. That's the hardest thing when you combine two words, simple words, and then you just combine them. Those tend to stick a lot. Yeah. And it's important to me trying to do this project because I ripped that straight from Young Guns. Yeah, I had that idea. And so on our demo, the original pressing of it, it starts with a sample from Young Guns where it's like, Why aren't they killing us? It's when they're like, tripping on Peyote going through this Indian village and they're like, Why aren't they killing us? We're in the spirit world, asshole. They can't see us. Really? Yeah. I don't know, I just ran with the whole Western thing. I kind of had that thought out before, so of course it's funny now. Like couple, you know, two, three years in, especially with the artwork, and now that we're touring more, I get a lot of people that are just like the combination of thrash and Western and horror and all this, that's the thing that I think separates a band the most. And that was the hardest idea to come up with. You know what I mean? To get excited to do a project. When I put all that together, the most thought went into the aesthetic and how do I build some sort of world? It looks, sounds at the whole thing. You could tell it's very well thought out. And for you, I assume it goes very deep, like your bloodline and your lineage. Like, your parents came from Texas and then moved to Nevada. I'm not sure how close they moved to Vegas. Yeah, on my mom's side, that's like the cowboy side of my family. They came up from Texas and it was probably in the so a couple of hours north of Las Vegas. They had a ranch out there that they were cattle and it was just a working cowboy ranch as my mom grew up. So when my grandfather passed away, she was left that and they sold it. Then she met my dad and kind of like mid 60s moved to Vegas, but for a big chunk of time she grew up walking to a little schoolhouse like Prairie Land shit, like total just hillbilly. So like that side of my family there's always been this know, cousins and stuff like doing pro rodeo. But then on the other hand, I had older brothers that are total punk rockers with like a half we had like a half pipe in the backyard. So I grew up in this weird thing where to me, those two worlds were always just kind of know it's. Like you get in the car with mom listening to Johnny Cash and George Jones and then if my older brother gets in, it's like misfits social d slayer. And so being like little you don't know what any of that is. And then as I got super into punk rock and hardcore and stuff and then you realize how weird that is to grow up in a family where it's like those are like the two things I was most excited about musically, like country and super underground shit. Yeah. It's crazy how that just subconsciously just kind of stuck with you. Yeah, it's weird. And you have that it's kind of like the push and pull because at one point I definitely got way away from reading westerns and kind of getting just wasn't as excited about that stuff. And then ten years goes by and you revisit it and you're even more excited. And country music too. I've never liked stuff like the pop country stuff, but like the old honky tonk outlaw country. And then I was lucky enough I caught that wave of alt country bands. So I followed that as closely, still do as I do, like thrash and death metal. So it's like having a band where I can subtly combine all the things I like in a way that still fits in with the heavy metal hardcore thrash scene is pretty cool. It sounds like you discovered it because you're printing out demos and singles from 2017 to you have the demo Viper, Blood, Spirit World and then you drop your first record, Pagan Rhythms, and that's obviously a massive jump. Yeah. So were you revisiting these memories from your childhood around there? I think what it was was I just decided I wanted to make a record. Not really being a band that was functional with bandmates and touring, sure. But I had this idea of like, I want to put a lot of energy into making a really good record and I was going to do more of like a punk rock country thing like the demo. And I had a bunch of it written. But as I started learning how to demo and track shit, started building out a little studio as soon as I could. I had Easy Drummer. Easy Drummer, too. And I started going through the loops. And then I'm like buying packs. And I got Matt from Hate Breed, put out like a drum loop pack. Oh, the fucking drum loop packs, dude, those are incredible. I wasn't good at doing the medi, but then I got like a drum loop pat from him. He had one? Yeah. And it had like a couple simple breakdowns that I could just steal. So he had like basically that was it. So then I'm like playing a guitar and all I'm playing is heavy ass shit. And so I just 180, took a Uturn, wrote Pagan Rhythms super hard, just all death metal, thrash hardcore and whatever. And now it's grown into its own thing. We're about to go tour with Sepultura. I saw that in the summer. Like the Europe festival run we got going is just like, wow. Yeah. And it's only been a couple of like it's funny how an idea like just change your mind, do something, put everything into it, and it bears fruit pretty quick. Yeah. I mean, it just looks like you put a lot of time into it. A lot from your first record, like 2001. And then less than two years later you have Death Western. And then obviously you're doing all these tours and you're already in Europe with Obituary and Agnostic Front and you have all these tours. And now you're touring with Sepatora and Creator. That's in June, right? Yeah, that's like a May June, like full us. Crazy death Angels on it too. Oh yeah. Sick, dude. Holy shit, dude. Isn't that crazy how you just make a simple decision and then the course of your life just changes? Yeah, because I was going to do it as a studio project and I was like, I'm going to write a couple of heavy records, some country, some punk rock, just do whatever I want with no not even getting into the industry stuff. The idea was just to make the records, put them out, and then maybe I would just go do some festival runs if it took off. And the next thing you know, it's like, I got to get the band together. It's like we're going on tour with Obituary. We played our first show like it's been just over a year. And in that time, that's it, man. Are you serious? Yeah. We played a couple off the demo stuff where we didn't play any heavy stuff because I hadn't written any of the metal yet a couple years ago. But our third show ever was like a year ago. So playing the metal stuff, like we learned the set decibel brought us out for the La Decibel Metal and Beer Fest. Yeah. And it was like Converge doing Jane Doe One night. So that was show number one. It's just like, okay. And then a month or six weeks after that, we're on the road with obituary, just like, let's go. Yeah, it seems like it is kind of, like, built up naturally. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you didn't even like, there was no pretense at first to have the sound, and then when the sound was developing, it just kind of, all right, this is it. Yeah, it still is to an extent. Like, I'm writing the third record right now and I finally know exactly what it's going to sound like. I haven't, like, because my older bands and stuff, like getting in a room with all your best friends trying to write riffs, I just was so tired of that approach. For good reasons, I'm sure. Yeah. I mean, it's great. The energy of that is fantastic. It's fun. But when you leave that room and you have a great riff, then you come back the next day and it just isn't the same. And then I hate that. So I like to just write, get the ideas, do it all. So write the drums, write the guitars, write all the vocals. And then the next record I'm doing, I'm combining more crazy influences into it where it's just going to be like, I feel like this is probably the idea that I should have had on the first one. But you need to write the songs, play the shows tour before you kind of understand where you're headed. Of course. So I feel like this new one I'm working on, I want to have it written before we leave for Sepultura and get it so I can get in the studio and be, whoa. Everybody takes several years to do records, but I'm on the other tip. Like, I'm pretty inspired. I'm trying to knock shit out of the park. Yeah. And I mean, for you, you are the main songwriter. All of it, like 95% plus you locking yourself in the room because it seems like to do all this music, I mean, you're already working on a third record. You're a very prolific dude. Yeah, I had a gap where I still played guitar and did a lot of stuff. I was writing songs, but I didn't share anything. And so I kind of feel a little\"\n",

Yeah, I had a gap where I still played guitar and did a lot of stuff. I was writing songs, but I didn't share anything. And so I kind of feel a little bit of pressure of like, now I'm like, I got Century Media behind us. We're giving them three records, so I'm like, it's going to be on them to pump the brakes. Like, they're going to get a record turned in and then they have in the contract however long to turn it in. So if they want to wait, they're going to have it, you know what I mean? So if they want to push the release, I'm going to try and have it done, I'd like to get it out. Summer 2024. Be like, that's it. I like trilogies, man. Trilogies are like horror movies, western. So I'm going to do these three metal records. Like, get it while it getting is good. Yeah, especially and you got to take advantage of when you're inspired, you got to take advantage of it, dude. And I got, like, my budy Sam Pura that engineers and produces our records. Me and him work really close together on this stuff, so we both have the idea for the next record. So it's like, I want to get it while it's hot. Oh, my goodness. Dude, I had a question. Like, the record has been out for a few months. How you been feeling? Well, it seems like well, you're just bragging more. Well, I don't know, man. I listen, and I'm so involved in it, by the time it comes out, I can't really listen to it anymore. And when I do, I'm like, I just hear the things that I nitpick, of course. And so it's cool that everybody likes it, and it's getting a great response. So I'm like, okay, cool. But the honest answer is, like, I'm over that shit. I'm not the kind of guy that listens back. I don't listen to pagan rhythms anymore. Once I finally get them in the can, it's like I want to write the next thing that shits all over those records. So I'm kind of never happy with whatever I just did. It's great, but I'm trying to do the that's the way it is, man. Yeah. It's that blessing. It's like a curse. Like, you're always hungry. Yeah, and it's the creative thing is the best part. I like when you just come up with the cool, whether it's a riff or a melody, whatever that is. That's my favorite part of all this. When it's like 1 second, you're playing guitar, nothing comes out, and you're just like, I fucking suck. Why do I even bother? There's nothing. And then the next day, something. Yeah. I don't know how it happens exactly. Sometimes the guitar like, I have a Telecaster. I do most of my writing on. Not a very metal guitar, but it just feels like, great. That's one thing I loved when I started doing research. I'm like, place a Fender telly before the research. I like listening to a discography just going so I went right when I heard the first demo. You just know that's the Fender Telecaster. Yeah. Then the second one, and then the other single. Did you use that same telly for pagan rhythms? No, on that. All of that. Because on the demos, it was written with the telly, and I did the demos of pagan Rhythms, but then when we tracked it for real, that was all with a gym root. It was a fender. He has that god, I don't know what it is. Like, flat black, like heavier than fuck. It's just like you could break down doors with that thing. He's either like the strat or the jazz master. It was a jazz master. Sam Pura has one. I think when he was doing the Hundredth record or something, they had a Fender deal. So he got the artist price or some shit. Great. So I touched that thing and was like, oh, that's the rhythm tone right there. And then I think it was he's got a couple of guitars. We usually use his stuff when we record just because they're set up and good to go. And he's an EverTune guy, which I hate. And so part of the recording thing, the give and take, I like really clear pop productions and his work with stories so far and hundredth and bands in his discography where I listen back and I'm like, oh my god, it's so clean and punchy and big. I want to do that but with thrash. And so part of that is like me, even though I hate using the EverTunes, like quad tracking meticulously, doing it piece by piece. And I'm like, it takes all the fun out of recording. But I'm getting closer to that guitar tone on a record that's in my head. Yeah, that journey is still like, I think I'm going to hit it on the next record. I'm sure everybody says that. But it's like in your head and you try to get it on the fucking record. It's like, why isn't it sounding like it sounds in my head? And then that makes you go to the next record and so on and so on. Yeah, and I like that too. Like the recording and the creating part is by far my favorite. Like playing shows is fun. It's exciting or whatever and makes you feel good. But the fun part is dialing in the guitar tone and you're like, I did it, but then I listened to it too much. And then now I listen. Yeah, exactly. Now I listen to Death Western. I'm like, fucking guitar tone sucks. Like, god damn it. Next one. The next one. How did you come up with the album titled Death Western? I was going to it's a great title, man. Yeah, and it fit into it. So it was a song title when I was writing the record. So I had it. It was just going to be a song. And I think Getter asked me on like a conference call or something. It was like Century Media and some management folks. But somebody was asking me somehow Getter jumped on it and it was like they pumped it as like they played Death Western. But that came about because I had the song title and I was like, this is a badass song title. I don't have a riff or anything yet, but this is a cool oh, wow. And then on a conference call when they were asking me like, well, what should we say? The type of music is with you blending this? I'm like, well, I like this song titled Death Western. That could be, like, the next album title, actually. And they're like, oh, that's perfect. And so then it kind of morphed into them marketing and doing their thing. Yeah. So I get people asking me, like, you're creating a new genre. I'm like, Pump the brakes, playboy. I'm just like, is what it is. But like, that Death Western title just I don't know where it came from. Just mix and death metal and it's you though western, it's simple, but it's kind of catchy enough where it's perfect, dude, coming out with those simple two words and put them together, that's the hardest thing to do. I consciously do it all the time. It's so hard to do, man. And you got it. Yeah. And it's hard to when it happens, you always feel way smarter. But the truth is it's a total accident. It's always an accident, dude. Like, Spirit World, Death Western and all these things fit so well together. But I couldn't do it again if somebody was like, dude, you're a genius at branding and marketing. Help me. I'd be like, I can't help you. I don't even know how I'm doing it. It's just dumb luck. And I don't know. Do you think there's like, a parallel with you being disciplined and hard work that those ideas just kind of fall out of the sky? I think so. I spend so much more time focusing on this stuff and the work aspect of it than an incredible amount of time. So to me, I feel like I work really hard and I get very little great riffs, great ideas, great visuals, but I get just enough that we need. I got an album title, I got a cool look for the band. So it's like, you only need half a dozen of these kind of great ideas. But for the time spent, it's like, I don't do it quick, I can tell you that. It takes me a long time of there's a lot of shitty, of course, song titles, so, yeah, I would say 100%. It's all just the maniacal amount of work that goes into trying to mine for gold. That's it. And then you get the one keeper. Yeah. It's like you're mining for gold without trying. Yeah. Then you just happen this one nugget of gold hits your mind. I don't know where like, what the heck did I come from? Or yeah, you've been mining for fucking five years. Yeah, that's the other thing, too, is a lot of people ask me when I'm writing because the blend of we don't do clean singing or anything, but we don't sound like everybody else, but we do have, like I guess we mix a few different underground genres that people don't typically mix the way that we do. And I'm just like, that's just the shit. I like, number one. I'm just a fan. So trying to write a record that I will truly love is the goal. And then I love old obituary like Slayer. But I also grew up through that golden age of hardcore where shit like Hate Breed Strife, like that Stompy era, I love that stuff. And so combining all those things to me is just easy because that's the stuff I like. Yeah, it seems like you never compromise your vision at any point. Well, when you cut out all the that's why I don't like getting in a room and writing or any of that stuff because I just want to do what I want to do. As selfish as that sounds. It's like sometimes you got to do it, man. Yeah, I'm doing it. For me, at the end of the day, I didn't plan on doing a whole lot with this band. And it just so happens that all these opportunities pop up that I'm taking advantage of. But it's like, I would still be making these records with or without Century Meter, anybody, you know what I mean? Which sounds weird to because some people need to tour or get that kind of fanfare or something out of it money or get a business. But I really like records, man. Like you said, when you stumble on a band that you like, I do that every week. I just am constantly looking for finding like, I need that new song, that new band, and that's just a part of my life for so long. I don't know. So I try and make that\"\n",

      "\"be making these records with or without Century Meter, anybody, you know what I mean? Which sounds weird to because some people need to tour or get that kind of fanfare or something out of it money or get a business. But I really like records, man. Like you said, when you stumble on a band that you like, I do that every week. I just am constantly looking for finding like, I need that new song, that new band, and that's just a part of my life for so long. I don't know. So I try and make that band. I try and be that band. Yeah, I want to be the band that if I found, I would literally just have to call my brothers, my best friends and be like, holy shit, dude, this is the band. You know what I mean? Like, when you're young and you feel that passionate about music, yeah, it's cool. It doesn't happen as much anymore. It's rare when a band really kicks my teeth in where I'm just like, Holy fuck. But that's kind of the goal, too, is like, I want to be that band for somebody else. Yeah, we're very similar in that way where just try to create your own favorite band. Yeah, it sounds simple, but it's not. Yeah, it sounds, you know, stupid, but yeah, when you actually try to do your oh, man, try to try to get that sound out of your know, it's tough. Yeah. And I was just listening to a lot like I said, I heard the pod with Dino on it. But I've been going back listening to Fear Factory quite a bit over the last year. I remember being in high school, they toured with Slayer and all my friends went to this show in Boise and came back and were just like, fair Factory fucking blew Slayer off the stage. And I was just like, Go fuck yourself. No way. And for whatever. When you're young and you just can't really get into something. I just could not really truly love Fear Factory until later. And now I keep going back to their first three records, and I'm just like, fucking incredible. God, what a fucking band. Over and over. I don't know. So I think I do that too, where it's like, you go back to things that 20 years ago, people were telling me, this is the best. This is the band. And I was too stupid or obtuse, whatever to hear it then. And then you it's cool to go back. I'm like oh, wow. Why did I not love this back then? Yeah, and I think as you grow up, too, you just stop ever hating on anything because, you know, like, maybe I can't hear it now, but I know myself in ten years, this could be my favorite record. So that's generally what I say. If someone tries to turn me on to something, I'd be like, Cool. I can't hear it right now, but maybe I'm open at some point. This could be my shit. Yeah, I remember in high school, everyone was jamming Dystopia, and I just didn't get it back then. But now it's like, I turned in my 30s love Dystopia, obsessed with Dystopia. It's so weird how your taste can change and evolve. Yeah, and I think it's cool, too, if you're open to it. That's where when you're young and you shut yourself off because you're only into these little narrow things. Yeah, it's nice to I just like finding new shit. That's the main thing. I like making new songs. I don't want to listen to the last song I did. I want to make the new one. I want to find the new band. Yeah. I don't know. It's that hunt. It's like the collector syndrome, you know? Not a lot of people have that. Like, that just constant hunger or just constantly hunting for new bands. It's a special person, man. If you look at a lot of your friends, not everyone has that hunger. No. And I don't know, I think I've always just been like that. I don't know. It's fun. It is. It's nice. And it's that little joy you get when you find something cool. Yeah, I've been listening to a lot of, like there's a lot of the new kind of American skinhead bands going, that just Oi stuff that I love. Oi. But you go through phases where I've heard every fucking band. You can only listen to Cox Bar so many times, but then there's all this new stuff popping off, like Liberty and justice and all these cool bands all over the US. So I've been, like the last few months just jamming the shit out of that too. I don't know, man. Yeah, and then you go through phases. Is this the band you're talking about? Yeah, I love Cox Bar. That's like I mean, it's a sick band name, literally. Shock troops is one of the best albums of all time. No doubt. What's it called? Shock troops, man. Right there. Oh, wow. That's like first wave punk rock, late 70s, late 70s. They don't get the cred in the US that they should. But I mean, front to back classic. Ten out of ten. Where are they from? They're from England somewhere. Why is there a lot of great punk rock come out of England? I don't know. Hard to say, man. A lot of good stuff. But there's a bunch of cool new bands. Liberty and justice out of Houston. Conservative military image, I think, like, out of Chicago, they were newer. Yeah. Slugger, I think, is out here. Slugger sick. Fucking badass, dude. Slugger's tight, man. I don't know if you guys are like, whoever listens. This pod, this is a heavy pod, but this is like I listen to a lot of stuff, man. I love punk rock, love street punk, Oi, all that stuff. There's a lot of versions of heavy, man, to always start the punk, the metal, the thrash, anything underground, too, like whether it's death core, death metal, thrash, black metal, like all that stuff. I don't know. I pull from all of it. I dig it. It makes sense when I listen to what Spirit World, you just throw everything in there. I do. And that's what I mean. On the new record, I found another way to blend some more of this stuff. So I'm going to bring in some more of the four on the floor. Catchy punk rock. Where the bridge? You bring it into more of a sing along thing because I haven't been doing that. I've been doing a lot of just like, fuck you. Here's, like the eight hardest riffs I wrote the last month. How do I put them together and just beat your head in? So now I'm going to do some more, kind of bring some other stuff into it that explains you being so hungry. And it's finding new bands and going back to older bands. Spirit World has this thing where only a few bands have only a few of them, where you could kind of play any show. You could go play with Agnostic front. Then you could play with Obituary. Today you're going to play with, like, a Death Corps band with Sulfur. Only a few bands can do that. Yeah. And the cool thing is we don't fit in with anybody because we come out in, like, rhinestone suits looking like a honky tonk band. And so when we were on tour with Agnostic Front, we're playing in Berlin and there's people that have been watching Agnostic Front for 30 years, that when we walk out, the vibe is, fuck this band. They're just looking at us like, what is this garbage? These dudes have cowboy hats on. And then halfway through the set, you just see them break down and they just can't help head banging a. Little bit. Wow. And then afterwards they come up, buy a record, and it's like having that being a little fearless too. It takes a little confidence to walk out into a room to a bunch of traditional skins and punk rock dudes and then play thrash metal in rhinestone suits. But if you can get over the hump of not giving a fuck what anyone thinks because, you know, the set is really good, you can win people over, man. And that's how you fit in. At least for me, it's like, have a crazy idea and then don't be afraid to put yourself out there. I don't care if it's we played with, like, Mind Force and Drain. That was our last show. Like, huge new school hardcore show. Yeah. So you play that and when we play, all the lights cut off and it's like we put on a show. So it's a totally different vibe than every other band. And then our next big tour will be with Sepultura, where it's like old school thrash legends, three of them, and then us. So I think it's important to try and who wants to be in a box, you know what I mean? I want to be able to play with all my favorite bands and I have such eclectic taste. I couldn't imagine doing it any other way. You got to be able to. Yeah. So when you're playing with Agnostic Front, like, you're talking, like, old school hardcore and you're wearing what you're you can you see the reaction in their faces. Yeah. No one had ever heard of us because that was our second time to Europe. And like I said, we've only been playing shows for a year. So we went over and did Bloodstock and did a handful of shows in August. And then we did a US tour with Creeping Death and 200 Stab Wounds, which that one that's the new school new wave of old school American death metal thing going on, which is also cool. But those kids all come out of the hardcore scene to some extent, so there's a lot of crossover. And then the Agnostic Front one, yeah, it's an older crowd and they had their whole run on Epitaph, so they have a lot of people that love their melodic anthemic songs, you know what I mean? So we come out and it's just brutal heavy shit, dude. It's crazy. You're only been like your first record came out a year before this and you're already playing a European festival. Yeah, man. Crazy. You guys are fucking nuts, dude. Well, and part of it, I was in old hardcore punk bands and you just learn if you want to be successful and carve it out, you got to get to Europe. And so it's like, you can wait two years or you can go kick the door in. And so that's one thing. As much time as I spend on the writing and creating all this stuff. You got to put yourself in the best position to succeed. That's why a guy like Mike Gitter, who he's like me, he's always finding new bands. Always, dude, that's another freak. But like, a guy like like, that's my segue into getting distribution by Sony, get picked up, have them rerelease the album that I released, DIY, and then that's how we were able to get to Europe. So it's like those two things. It's like, you got to know who books the bands you love and randomly, Nick Storch hit me up\"\n",

So it's like those two things. It's like, you got to know who books the bands you love and randomly, Nick Storch hit me up because he loves Pagan Rhythms. So right then, I was like, random. I was like, that's the best guy. Like, if I could pick a booking agent, that would be the guy. And he's already showing his cards that he loves my band. So then it's like, well, shit, Nick Storch loves my band. This is going to be like you manifested without even trying. I think part of it was because I kind of knew what to do if you had it. Like, for being around and knowing a lot of people and then not having the I didn't need any of this to happen, but I was smart enough to pay attention and be like but if it was going to happen, these are the people that you connect with. And these are the things you do to go break a band, dude, you just have this natural quality. Because the question you get is it's old? How do you get a manager? Guards? How do you get, like, a booking agent? You're like, I don't know. You write a record that makes those people fucking when they hear it go, Yo. And then they call somebody and say, you hear this. It's the same thing. It's like it happened. It's not because I'm anybody's darlin. I'm not in the click. I'm nobody's like, boy. So it's like the make a record. That should be the most important thing instead of getting with your friends and putting out those five songs immediately for $1,500. It sounds like shit, and you love it. Take time, man. Make the art number one, and then it cuts through the noise. Yeah. If you're willing to put in that time the time and money. Because I recorded Pagan Rhythms. All that's out of pocket. And I mean, I spent the same amount on that that Century Media gave me for our next record. So it's like, Whoa, yeah, I'm willing to like, I believe that I can make a great record. And I knew to make a great record, you got to get in the studio. It's going to cost you, like, ten grand. What if no one buys it? It's like, Well, I'm out ten grand, but I'll be proud of a record. And no one was pushing me to do these things. There's no outside pressure. It was all just self driven. So then when I put it out, I sold out the first vinyl pressing within months. So it was like immediately, it's like, okay, the record is good. You don't need hype if the shit's good and it does it itself. You know what I mean? When the music does it itself. Yeah, the artwork and the music, I don't know. And I realized that I have a good career, and so I come from a place where I could save up money and be like, I don't need help. I can write the whole thing. I can record it. I can pay for a pressing, and if I lose out, it'll suck. But I'm willing to do it because I need to make a record. And I realize that's an incredibly blessed position to be in. Even, like, five guys sometimes can't figure out how to get three grand each to do their songs justice. Yeah, man, you just had that freaking natural something inside you. I'm always kind of like, fascinating. Where does that shit come from? I don't know. It's weird. People ask me, and I don't think it's talent. I think it's almost like a level of maybe it's like just like a love letter type thing. It's like that pride. Maybe it's like, if you're going to make a record, what's stopping you from making a record as good as your favorite indie label? Whether you're into metal or whatever, pick your favorite label. If it's $20, spin. How much do they spend on these records? Yeah, they all use the same 20 engineers. The same 20 producers. They master them. It's like nothing really truly separates you from any of that, at least in this day and age. It's true. So if you know what they're doing and you have good songs, why can't you make a record that immediately catapults your band? The answer is you can just do the work. Yeah. I mean, you put out the first record. Being independent, I just got it picked up by literally from a label from a booking agent. People just want to work with crazy let's Death Western. The COVID James Bowsema from Las Vegas. Everybody that worked on the record, all the artwork and layout, are all my friends from so, like, we went and ate tacos at El Puerto Marisco's, sat down, and I was like, here's the idea for the record I want to take, because I wrote a book of short stories that came out with pagan rhythms. It has all the characters. It's this big concept between the records and the book. So I was just, like, describing the characters I wanted. I'm like, I want a 1960s, like, horror movie poster or an old western where you take the characters and you just like so basically, I just asked him to draw me a movie poster, and then he gave me some sketches and was like, jeez, man, what coloring do you like? And he had I got to post it, but we have, like, three or four of the other colorways. And like, the sketches, they're pretty cool. But I love the orange. I'm like super bright and it doesn't look like anybody else. So I'm like, that's the one, like big ass cowboy on it. Smoking. Let's go. Sticks out. It fits the vibe, man. It fits like the record title, everything. Yeah, man. It's hard to get all those elements to align. And it's a fucking special thing when all those things is fucking this lineup. And I didn't peg him to do the record, actually getter wanted. He had this Frank Frazetta piece. And I love Frazetta. And it was like something from the 70s where it's like an Indian and a cowboy, like Tussling with the tomahawk, like in the dirt. It's pretty violent. It's a great picture. And so we talked to the Frazetta's daughters that handle his estate now and got permission to license it because they won't license stuff to just yeah. And so on one hand, I was like, my older brother that plays bass loves Frank Frazetta, Death Dealer, all this comic book shit. And so he's like, on one hand, shitting his pants. He's like, dude, you can get a fucking Frazetta. Do it. Do it. And I wanted to, but then on the other hand, I was like, yeah, but it doesn't have the characters from my book. I want to get somebody that can custom do it. And every artist I hit up was like, no, can't do it. Not for that budget. If you want an actual painting with all this custom bullshit, fuck you. I'm not the guy. And then we played with municipal waste. And the guy Tony was like, oh, yeah, check this out. And showed me the COVID of their last record. And it was my budy from Vegas did it. And I was like, Fuck. I was like, I'll fucking hit him up. And it wasn't their record. It was actually the tour art for the tour. We were yeah, he drew this minotaur with like a battle vest with all the bands on patches, just crazy shit. And I was like, well, if he can do a fucking minotaur with a bunch of heavy metal patches on it, maybe he can do my movie poster. Yeah, you really combine not only music stuff, but stuff from film. Yeah. It would have been sick to do Frazetta. I love his style. But at the same time, I do have this big I like my own stuff. Like I want to build my own mythology with my band. And it's like as cool as it would be to license that, everybody does that. You pick a great artist, you license something. It doesn't actually fit with the subject matter. You're lucky if it does somehow, some way, like conceptually. But sometimes that's random. Sure. So for me, I really wanted to have just build my own shit. That's always cooler to me. I think it is, man. You want to be a leader. Yeah, he just did the new Frozen Soul that's coming out. He did the COVID of that. I think they just released it on their new single that came out. I think yesterday really came out. Yeah. That's another band name I heard about from the famous Mike Getter. Yeah. Frozen Soul Rolls, man. What's their sound like? I never jammed them. They're like old school death metal. Like little chainsaw, but they're heavy as fuck. Yeah. And they're like all Texans, just like giant dudes. They're great, man. They fucking bring out a snow machine at some of their shows, make the lights blue. They have this whole fetish for everything. Cold, cold school death metal, baby. Oh, just my logo. Okay. We're fucking serious, dude. Yeah, that's a new serious. Yeah, James did that one, too. It's sick. Really? Whoa, what? What is going on? Want to he showed me we had lunch a couple weeks ago and he showed me all the artwork, but I'll let them reveal their yeah, that's fucking there's some cool stuff with that artwork that ties into like, the front and back. It's tight. A full on concept. Yeah, it's cool. I love that shit, man. When there's really thought put into it. Who mixed your last record? Sam Pura. He engineered mixed and then he was going to master it. And then this dude Alberto in Austin. What were we doing? I think we were trying to see if anybody could beat his master because we had a mastered version. And so we had two or three different people do a test master and this friend of Sam's, Alberto just fucking crushed it, man. Sounds great. Yeah. It reminds me of like a 90s, like, Colin Richardson mix. Exactly. That's like the reference stuff that I was showing Sam. I'm like, dude, the old the Machine Head. All these roadrunner releases that came out. Colin Richardson. Yeah. Jay. Look up. Colin Richardson. I'm curious. Like the records he did in the 90s. Fucking bolt thrower. Machine Head. Bolt thrower. Yeah. Fuck yeah. Oh, my goodness, dude. Yeah, he rules, man. And he doesn't do a lot of interviews and stuff. I wonder why he should. I don't know. There's very little stuff. But he's got some incredible albums, man. Machine Head. What\"\n",

And I think I want to say he's definitely like in England somewhere too, man. He is in England. Yeah. He did. Cannibal corpse bloodthirst. I know that because I always kind of go on that record. When did bloodthirst come out? That's 90s, right? I don't know what year that one was. Late 90s, probably. Bloodthirst has to be ninety s ninety nine. Boom. Oh, barely got it, dude. Barely got it. Yeah. That's a fucking Colin mix, man. Classic. Yeah. I love the big when the old industry, when they had the majors and the bigger indies, when they would spend 200 grand on a record. And it's like, those are the ones that I can't get out of my head because it's like the classic Ministry albums and Fair Factory Machine Head, like Life Agony, even like Mad Ball. The bands that were coming out on roadrunner in the 90s, like the polish and the drum tones and the sounds, I'm just like, they're so fucking good, man. And it was all the tape. It was into that transition where it was still like really nice studios, huge budgets. And those are the records where I'm like, in my head, I want to sound like that but modernized. Just pick my favorite parts of those. The that's a dream, man. Make something that shits on Colin Richardson. Can you do that? Is that possible? Probably not. But that should be the it's. It's nothing like a good fucking sounding produced record. Yeah. And I love big ones. I'm not afraid of the pop sound. So if you listen to Death Western and Headphones, there's a lot of space you can hear, and it's just really punchy and dynamic. I hate the compressed a lot of records when you listen to them, it's just so compressed and you just don't have that pop. I like that big shit. Yeah, there's like a big sonic difference from the first record to your second record. Yeah. And that's like being critical, like not having the time because Pagan Rhythms, like, I paid for it and it was good, but it was also like there's a lot of things it's like, okay, out of Money, out of Time sounds good. Let's go. And then for the next one, me and Sam were like, okay, we're going to fucking hit this one out of the know. It's crazy how you could go do the same person. But it will sound the next record will sound completely different. Yeah, it always kind of blew me away just by having a couple conversations prior it's like a couple the mixing on Death Western, I've never done it like this, but we did it remote where I would log in. He has a way to do a stream. So I'm hearing the sound that's coming out of his computer in the studio. And so for like a month, dude, I would get off work when he'd get in there. We'd spend four or 5 hours a day just mixing the fuck you serious? Out of Death Western, like more time spent on that than probably any other piece of the recording thing. And it was like the last week, all that time we thought we had some good rough mixes. And then something happened in the last week where it finally just happened, where it's like, holy shit. And it just sound incredible. And if we hadn't spent that much time, it wasn't there. It sounds crazy, but all that tweaking out on it thinking it sounded good. It was like the final 1015 hours, it just came together, finally got the guitars, to sit, the drums, everything, where it was just like, boom, that's it. That sounds like a lot of agony. Horrible. That's why I can't listen to it. That's why all that time listening to it, I'm just like, one day ten years from now, I'll revisit these, and I'll probably love them, but right now, no. So you mix it remotely so you hear what he's hearing, where you're at. Yeah. And never heard of my in my life. Dude, the COVID shit, man, opened up a whole new world of doing things at my job too. I never worked remote before. I've always been, like, in construction type shit. And I moved into process management. And I have a remote job now where it's like I do a lot of the things. I don't go in for meetings. I jump on zoom. And it's crazy. Like, I'm virtual guy, and my job didn't exist a couple of years ago, and it damn sure didn't exist the way that we do it now. Same thing with mixing a record. So all these technology, like, weird things all just kind of work in my favor too. Like dumb luck, because I couldn't have went up to the studio and spent that much time. Like, no way. But being able to knock out three or four know, jump on sitting in my bed with my know, jen would come walking in from work and I'd be like, headphones on, like, listening to and be like, no, bro, the fucking Snare. It's like, the snare the snare needs to go up. And then you get the snare up, and then you lose whatever it is. That's what we did day after day. It's like, this sounds good. This sounds fucked. This sounds good. This sounds fucked. You're fired. Bounce it down. Bounce it. And that was another thing with the label where everybody has an idea of who should we have mix it, who should we have do. I just I already knew I was going to do the record with Sam, so I was a pretty bad creative partner for Getter and the label and everybody and our management. Because I love I love all the guys you're talking about. When I'm done, if you don't like the mix, then we can have somebody else take a crack at it. But I got it. Don't worry. You see, that's always the tough part, which guide me through this. At what point do you like, you listen to somebody and you know when not to listen? You got to go with your gut. When you're younger, you think everybody knows. They have this special experience, life experience, talent, and they know more than you. And I learned in my business career and in the band stuff, nobody spends as much time as I do with my stuff. Nobody. Like, I spend thousands of hours on it. And everybody else that ever comes in with an opinion, maybe they listen to the demos that I sent them to check out. Maybe they listen to them three times. I've listened to them a hundred times, and maybe they've worked with Arthur Risk. I love his productions. On, like, Power Trip, he did the new creator. There was a bunch of great guys that I would love to work with, respect their work. But me and Sam have a special connection of making records that nobody else understands. And so I just had to like, you just got to be unafraid to go with your gut. That's it. And there's no wrong answer because it's art, right? Like, you could have had five different guys mix it. But you got to believe what you're doing is special. And if something's that special to you, I really believe, would you just have somebody that's never heard your band come in at the last second to mix it? Is that special? Or is it special to have the guy that you recorded your demo, pagan rhythms, everything that's like, that's your fucking boy that's going to spend a month mixing it because it's important, and he knows how special it is for you to get this record out to me, even if we would have fucked it up like that. Experience in some ways means more than having a named guy in the metal scene. You know what I mean? So I don't know, man. It's like no one can do it for you. You just got to know when to take somebody's good idea and when to say, I got it, man. Just trust me. If I fuck it up, I'll own it. But I got this. Yet it's such a struggle, the word ego comes to mind. Is it going with your gut? Is it ego? Is it your real vision? And is the ego off when you really stick to your guns? Well, that's the thing where you fuck it up. If the record sounds really bad and you don't hit it out of the park, but you're the one that's saying, no, I got it, I got it. I'm right. Then it's probably ego. And you're probably an asshole. You probably should have listened. You probably should have listened to somebody. But it's a fine line. It's a fine line, dude. Yeah. And you got to roll the dice, too, because it's so easy to mess up records, especially mixing and engineering. Like, everybody that's ever made a record knows it's always about to just go off the cliff. It's like, damn, are we about to break up right now? It's always going, yeah. And I just think that I'm in a lucky position where I have a really close friend with a great studio that we're trying to capture the same thing. And this third record, we both have an even better idea of where we're going with it. So I think the leap from Pagan Rhythms to Death Western to the new one, when we're done, people will see it's going to be a sonic thing, you know what I mean? Which I think is cool. Not a lot of bands get to do that where you have multiple records with the same team, everybody 100% firing on all cylinders, trying to crush it. That's also a blessed place to be. Yeah. It sounds like you have this deep connection. You found someone that just shares the vision and trying and get what you have in your mind or what you're hearing out. Okay. You're trying to get this out into the speakers. Yeah, man. And the other thing I really like about Sam is we do not like the same music. He loves new metal. He's younger than me, so he's like a big new metal guy. But he loves fucking pop music and all kinds of shit that I don't listen to. Wow. So when he gets excited about an arrangement or some of the production choices and he's really geeking out over it, sometimes I don't even know what he's talking about. I can't even hear it. He's one of those guys that can hear and be like, oh, the overheads, the clarity. And there's like transient\"\n",

      "\"Sam is we do not like the same music. He loves new metal. He's younger than me, so he's like a big new metal guy. But he loves fucking pop music and all kinds of shit that I don't listen to. Wow. So when he gets excited about an arrangement or some of the production choices and he's really geeking out over it, sometimes I don't even know what he's talking about. I can't even hear it. He's one of those guys that can hear and be like, oh, the overheads, the clarity. And there's like transient detail here. And I can't tell the difference. He's like ABN with some plug in on and I'm like, dog, cool. I'm glad you're stoked because I literally can't tell the difference of what the fuck you're talking about. But he's like got the weird he's got the geek thing, which is I don't have that. I can't listen to something and be like, oh, you need to knock out some 4K here, dog. Go ahead and notch the EQ. Like, I'm not that guy. So I have to like I don't know. You got to have a team, man. Especially like if you know you're not great at something. So there's trust there. There's trust involved from your side. Yeah. And that's a big thing, man. You just got to say I can't hear what he's talking about, but I believe he knows what he's talking about. So do it, man. That's such a fucking hard balance, dude. Yeah. Oh my yeah, because that could bomb know. That's the other thing. Yeah, we definitely had we also we are real adamant about Thomas Printon played drums on the record and he's incredible drummer. But I didn't want to have a bunch of samples on the Snare or kicks that weren't ours. So we did sample everything. But it's him on the fucking Snares. We use tune different whatever, but we just blended all of our samples. And so I've had a lot of people tell me, like, oh yeah, your drums are programmed, and just say shit like that. And I'm like, no they're not, motherfucker. This is all like literally crazy performances captured. It's just like the way you do it, man. Isn't that like I'm not saying he started doing this, but isn't that like what Colin does? Basically the performance is there. Everything's mic'd up and then you do the sound replacing. So you get the sound, but you get the different I'm big into I just geek out over production of records. And I looked at a lot of Tom Petty stuff that he did with Jeff Lynn where that production style where instead of recording the entire drummer playing the whole kit, it's like other people do it, too. Like Eric Valentine did it on the Queens of Stone Age record, the one that Dave Grohl played on, where it's like, don't play the fucking no hands. Don't play the symbols. And so they track them differently. So Dave Grohl doesn't know the songs and he's like, playing by feel. So then when they go back and try and comp the takes together, it's almost impossible. So all those little things, I geek out over records and I'm like, how the fuck did they get these drums like this? Why aren't the overheads and the symbols washy? And it's like, oh, they recorded them separate. That's why there's no, like, Tom bleed or snare or kick. It's like it's only the high hat being played. And then they got to match it know? But it's not to the so, like, all those little things is what me and, like, connect. We don't listen to the same type of music, but we listen to the same productions. And even if it's a band he doesn't like, I'll send him a shit and be like, this production right here. And then we just break it down. Like, how the fuck did they do it? Google every person that worked on the record, dude. Just geek shit, man. That explains a lot. And you'll be surprised. I've come to realize this. Not a lot of people do the Googling and finding names and the names and what studio we're at and what year. To us, it's like, well, yeah, you were just doing it. You was doing it. But a lot of people don't do that. Yeah, I love that stuff. When I hear a band, I like or a record, I like once the initial thing where I just listen to it and I'm just like, wow, this is great. Then I'm like, how'd they do it? Who wrote all the songs? Who produced it? Who engineered it? What studio did they use? Who mastered it? Exactly. Then I'm like well, who mixed it? Who mastered it? So it's like this whole thing. It's like, I look at records more like, how do you make a movie where nobody talks shit on a director for bringing in a great cinematographer, even though that guy totally shapes the tone, color, like, visual of the film. But sometimes with music, people are like, oh, you write your song, but you're bringing in a producer that I don't look at it that way. I'm like, the end result is important. And if you have to get specialized people to do it, I don't want to know the recipe. Of the meal. I just want the meal to be banging. That's the way you put it. Yeah, I take that approach, too. If we've got to do some tedious shit like quad tracking guitars, even though I fucking hate it, because you have to just it takes the fun out of it. But how else are you going to get it that clean to where the end result is in the ballpark of what I want? Yeah. So you go in into songs or record or concept where you have the vision first, it seems. Yeah. When you have the vision first and what you have in your head first and then you just try to execute. Yeah. For this new record, it's going to sound weird, but I know it's going to be a darker it's a trilogy, right? So it's like Star Wars. It's like, this is going to be like the dark cliffhanger. It's going to be a much darker record. But I also want to have, like I want to start it with some horror movie, real gothic things, rip into a couple of fast thrash songs. Then I want to do some sort of blue, grassy country stuff that's going to be kind of left field. But I'm just mapping out the record. So it's like Side A, okay, I've got Side A done, and everything has to be vinyl for me, when I think about a record, because I came up in that era where it's like, you got a Side A and a Side B. So Side B, when you flip it over, it has to fucking punch you in the mouth. Has to be good. But Side B for like, a metal band, has to be as good as Side A. You can't have any filler. Wow, I never thought about it that way. Yeah, I don't know. I guess I'm a freak. But yeah, I map out the whole record and then it's like, so what songs are actually in here? I'm like, I need three or four fast, heavy thrash songs and I've got two weird kind of countryish rockabilly things I want to do. And then I've got an outro and an intro. It can't be over, like, 35 minutes because that shit's fucking too long. Nobody can listen to a record longer than that. So it's like, carve all that out. And then on the other hand, I've got all these riffs where I'm just like looping drums, riffing, riffing, riffing. And I'm like, now take those, carve those up, where do they fit? And I can't do that if I got to explain every step to a homie and be like, here's this song. I'm going to do this. And then they have their idea. I have too many goals I have to set for each song and for the record. So it's got to be just in the trenches doing the work. You're right, man. I'm definitely a big guy. I always tell people, you got to jam in a room together in a full band. But you know what meeting people like used to it's not for everybody. Some people just work better alone. And I got a day job. It's like if I only did music where we could just hang out and play. It would be badass to just play music with people all the time just to get that other inspiration. Like that weird stuff where the drummer hits like a groove you would never think of. But also got to be realistic. I work for a living, so ain't got time. Ain't got time. Ain't got the money. So I got to do it efficiently. And time too. Yeah, when it says you which you could just do so much more. And you don't got to worry about any bullshit around you. You don't have to worry about this person. This person can wake up at noon. So I got to wait, start going. I can be really hard on myself. I'm way harder on myself than I would be to you. Like, if you showed me a cool riff. I'm a bit of a people pleaser. So I'd be like, it's cool, man. But what I really want to say is, yeah, not good enough. Your riff fucking sucks. Yeah, it could be there. If I were you, I would spend another like I would ten more hours and then come back. But I'm not going to tell somebody that because I'm always way harder on myself. But working solo, it's like I hear it and I'm like, it's not there. Fucking delete it next. Which it's a lot easier for me to self critique than it would be to build that trust and not hurt somebody's feelings or just cause a giant shit show. You know what I mean? Man, you're just putting hours in hours. Yeah, man. So much work. Cut. But I love doing it. So that's the other thing that I think separates the men from the boys. Are you inspired? Do you love what you're doing? Because that's going to come through. You can't fake that. True. And you have a trilogy of videos for Death Western. You also come up with the concept of the videos as well. So the videos, a lot of that visually the story stuff is an old friend of mine from high school that has been doing film stuff the whole time as a career. So all these sick ass videos, they kind of fit into the world. But this is all my buddy Tod and all his friends that work on a super low budget. And I tell them the basic premise, and then he's just like, what can we do? Can we burn down a church? We really wanted to burn down a church, but we couldn't get the permits to permits. Yeah, because it's a whole thing. And so all the things that you see in these videos are like we have really big crazy ideas, and it's like, how do we do it? And then it's just same thing with Sam. It's like, this is one of my super close friends that loves my band, loves the vision, and gives a shit. So it's like, our videos are going to look like they're going to look\"\n",

It's like, this is one of my super close friends that loves my band, loves the vision, and gives a shit. So it's like, our videos are going to look like they're going to look like we spent ten times more. They look incredible, dude. Yeah, man. I like film stuff too, so it's like, I don't want to be in a band that does a video where it's four guys in a dark room playing in a warehouse. To me, I'd rather curry yourself, probably. Yeah. That's not what I'm here for. I want to do a video where it's like, people watch and they're like, what is this shit? Is this a movie? So first you start with the premise, and obviously you take it to the pros and, hey, let's try this, and then try to execute. And then a bunch of our friends, everybody in these videos is just like, friends of friends that are super talented that in Vegas, we have a big showbiz. There's a lot of people that work on the so, like, we have people know are circus. Like, the actress right there is like a contortionist professionally. And so we knew she was on board. So it's like, let's make her a demon. We'll kill her and then have her come back to life. And she does all this crazy she can bend in half. So it's like, I could never come up with that. But when you know you have a world class contortionist that is one of the best in the world, that works at Cirque, it's like yeah. There you go. Oh, my goodness, dude. Yeah. I don't know, man. It's cool. Like, all that artistic stuff. It's like when you get up for ten years putting steel toes on, working construction, and then over here, the creative part, you just can't express it because you don't have an outlet. When you get the chance to do it, fucking go hard. Do it. It's your band. Everybody's got a guitar in a basement. But this is my shit. So it's like, I want to do stuff that I'm inspired. I want my video to be, like, crazy. That's accomplished. Yeah, man. It's so important how everything needs to line up. Like, the music needs to be there. Like, the vision and the videos and the artwork. You got it, dude, and you fucking did it. That's the thing that's like, when you look back at it, like, being prolific is, like, one thing, but if the stuff is good, if you never relent where you're like, every piece has to be good, then you can truly be proud of your stuff. You don't have any of that cringey shit where you're just like, we phoned it in and then excuses. No money, no time, whatever. You know, deep. Like when you phone it in and then you make excuses later. You do. And that's the stuff. Like, I learned that the hard way. One part of me is like, never again. Shit's got to be never again. Never. It's not worth it. I'd rather not do it than to phone it, know? Well, Stew Spray World's badass. Thank you, man. We should end it on a high. Uh, I appreciate you making the drive down from my Vegas. You got a sick out show tonight. Playing with a Death Corps band. My boys have sulfur, baby. You guys could play any show you want. Flyer. Holy moly, dude. You guys could play with Agnostic Front and then play the Affliction studio in Sewell Beach. Yeah. Why not, man? That's the dream, dude, not many bands can do that. It's fucking badass. Like I said, it's a blessed place to be, man. Build your band and your project. How? You don't don't get put in a box? Fuck, no. Well, Stu, where can people find you the band? Where should people go? Shit. Instagram, basically. Our guitar player is doing it for me, so Spirit World profit on Instagram. And then our web store is down for merch, but we're about to open it back up with somebody doing fulfillment. So Spiritworldprofit.com will have cool all the merch. Give it a week or two. I don't know when this comes out, but yeah, man, then we'll be on the road. Like the road, dude. That's it. Come out to a show. All right, Steve. Thank you for your time. Can't wait to do the show tonight. I'm stoked. Yeah, man. All right. One that's it. Later. Later.\"\n",
